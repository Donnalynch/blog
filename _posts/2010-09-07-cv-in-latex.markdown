title: "My professional CV in LaTeX"
---

After a long period of planning I finally migrated my professional CV
from Word to LaTeX last weekend. Since I live in the European Union I
used the *europecv* LaTeX class.

I’ve uploaded the LaTeX code into *GitHub* feel free to borrow it for
your CVs if you like it. You’ll have to compile the *master.tex* file
with *pdflatex* to get a nicely formatted pdf version of the CV.
