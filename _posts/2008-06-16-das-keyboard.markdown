title: "Das Keyboard"
---

Every professional developer knows how important to the development
process the keyboard is, so it is only natural to be on the look for
some quality piece of hardware. After a long research in the area of
good keyboards I decided to upgrade my current rig to the recently
released “Das Keyboard 3″. I have long heard stories about its quality
and comfort and I hope I’ll experience them myself soon. So what are
waiting for – research the market yourselves and make your pick, your
hands deserve a quality keyboard!
