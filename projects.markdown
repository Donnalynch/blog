I happen to maintain/work on a couple of projects. In no particular
order they are:
* [Spellbook](http://code.google.com/p/spellbook-dictionary/)
* [find-file-in-project](https://github.com/bbatsov/find-file-in-project)
* [zenburn colour theme for Emacs](https://github.com/bbatsov/zenburn-emacs)
* [Emacs Dev Kit](https://github.com/bbatsov/emacs-dev-kit)
* [Project Euler solutions in Clojure & Common Lisp](https://github.com/bbatsov/project-euler)
