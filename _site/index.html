<h2 id="javanext---the-groovy-programming-language20110506jvm-langs-groovyhtml"><a href="/2011/05/06/jvm-langs-groovy.html">Java.next() - The Groovy Programming Language</a></h2>
<p>In a series of articles labeled “Java.next()” I’ll be discussing
modern alternatives to the Java programming language for use with the
Java Platform. This is the first installment of the series - “The
Groovy Programming Language”.</p>

<h1 id="overture">Overture</h1>

<p>We all know and love the Java <em>platform</em>(note the emphasis on
platform) for a couple of obvious reasons. Most notably it features a
huge high quality standard library and a legendary execution
environment - the Java Virtual Machine(JVM). The JVM is known to
posses the following qualities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Runs on all major platforms</li>
  <li>Enterprise ready</li>
  <li>Extremely stable</li>
  <li>Extremely fast</li>
  <li>Highly customizable - many aspects of its work can easily be
adjusted such as GC settings, heap settings, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is a terrific community around the Java platform that has
contributed an immense amount of high quality software vital to the
success of Java. Hibernate, Spring, Eclipse, NetBeans, the myriad of
Apache projects are all community efforts.</p>

<p>So far so good, but it’s not all rainbows and unicorns in the land of
Java. The Java programming language is a common source of gripe
amongst many developers for various reasons. I’ll list here some of
the more notable of them:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s not a pure OOP language(there is a difference between primitive
and reference data types)</li>
  <li>It uses static typing(highly subjective topic, but commonly brought up)</li>
  <li>It doesn’t have support for closures(which instantly kills half of
functional’s programming ideas such as higher order functions)</li>
  <li>It has limited meta programming capabilities(compared to Ruby and
Lisp for instance)</li>
  <li>There is no concept of top-level procedures(outside of class
definitions)(this makes Java unsuitable for creating “script” programs)</li>
  <li>Its syntax is too verbose</li>
  <li>It’s not suitable for the creation of DSLs</li>
  <li>Its development is sluggish and restrained by the corporate promise of backward compatibility </li>
  <li>It’s an imperative language</li>
  <li>Its parallel programming model is revolving mostly around locks and
threads</li>
</ul>

<p>Naturally there are some languages that alleviate some(most) of Java’s
problems such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ruby</li>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>Lisp</li>
  <li>Erlang</li>
  <li>Haskell</li>
</ul>

<p>They all, however, lack(with their default implementations at least)
an execution environment that can match the JVM. They also lack Java’s
immense amount of libraries currently available. When enthusiasts
started porting existing languages to the JVM this came as no surprise
- it was only logical. A good language get a good execution
environment. For instance some folks ported Ruby to Java which
resulted in JRuby, Python also got a Java port called Jython. Though a
lot of good has come from such ports they was also a price to pay. In
the case of Ruby and Python some libraries are not written in
Ruby/Python, but in C for performance reasons, which naturally leads
to problems when you factor in a Java implementation of the
language. There is also the fact that the JVM(currently) doesn’t have
support for dynamic memory dispatching which is feature vital for
dynamically typed languages to get a decent performance. For this
reason Jython is notoriously slow. The JRuby team did a much better
work, circumvented a lot of the JVM limitations and actually managed
to create a Ruby implementation that in some scenarios beats the
performance of the standard MRI Ruby 1.9 with it’s custom YARV virtual
machine implemented in C. JRuby will be the object of a further
discussion down the road. Some of the languages that were ported to
the JVM suffer from another problem as well - it’s not straightforward
and efficient in them to reuse existing Java libraries directly.</p>

<p>I’d like to lead this discussion in another direction, however -
programming languages that were implemented from scratch with the JVM
as their execution environment. While there are many of those three
stand out and have gathered a significant momentum in recent
years. They will be the subject of this post and the following
two. Without further adieu I’d like you to meet Groovy, Scala and
Clojure.</p>

<p>We’ll begin our discussion with Groovy…</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong></p>

<p><em>Before I start I’d like to point out that my knowledge of Groovy is
limited compared to my knowledge of Scala and Clojure. Despite this I
decided to share my thoughts on the language because it’s certainly one
of the most popular JVM languages out there. If I’ve made any errors
in the article I didn’t mean to insult anyone with my ignorance and
I’ll certainly be glad to fix them when someone points them out.</em></p>

<h1 id="a-little-bit-of-groovy-history">A little bit of Groovy history</h1>

<p>James Strachan first talked about the development of Groovy in his
<a href="http://radio-weblogs.com/0112098/2003/08/29.html">blog</a> in August
2003. Several versions were released between 2004 and 2006. After the
JCP(yep, you read that correct - Groovy is actually a Java standard
which is great or scary depending on your point of view)
standardization process began, the version numbering was changed and a
version called “1.0” was released on January 2, 2007. After various
betas and release candidates numbered 1.1, on December 7, 2007, Groovy
1.1 Final was released and immediately rebranded as Groovy 1.5 as a
reflection of the many changes that were made.</p>

<p>In July 2009, Strachan wrote on his blog that “I can honestly say if
someone had shown me the Programming in Scala book by Martin Odersky,
Lex Spoon &amp; Bill Venners back in 2003 I’d probably have never created
Groovy.” Strachan left the project silently a year before the
Groovy 1.0 release in 2007. Leadership of the project was assumed by
Guillaume Laforge (Project Manager and JSR-241 Spec Lead). Under his
guidance Groovy thrived and his risen to be arguably the most widely
used JVM language apart from Java.</p>

<p>Currently the development of Groovy proceeds with a very fast pace and
the latest major update 1.8.0 was released just a couple of days ago.</p>

<h1 id="installation--getting-started">Installation &amp; Getting started</h1>

<p><strong>Platform independent installation</strong>
These instructions describe how to install a binary distribution of Groovy.</p>

<ul>
  <li>download a <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/Download">binary distribution of Groovy</a> and unpack it into some file on your local file system</li>
  <li>set your GROOVY_HOME environment variable to the directory you unpacked the distribution</li>
  <li>add GROOVY_HOME/bin to your PATH environment variable</li>
  <li>set your JAVA_HOME environment variable to point to your JDK. On OS
X this is /Library/Java/Home, on other unixes its often /usr/java
etc. If you’ve already installed tools like Ant or Maven you’ve
probably already done this step.</li>
</ul>

<p>For instance here’s the relevant information of my shell’s
configuration:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">JAVA_HOME</span><span class="o">=</span>/usr/java/latest
<span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">GROOVY_HOME</span><span class="o">=</span>/opt/groovy-1.8.0
<span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">PATH</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$GROOVY_HOME</span>/bin:<span class="nv">$PATH</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You should now have Groovy installed properly. You can test this by
typing the following in a command shell:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="gp">$</span> groovysh
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Which should create an interactive groovy shell where you can type
Groovy statements. Or to run the Swing interactive console type:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="gp">$</span> groovyConsole
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>To run a specific Groovy script type:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="gp">$</span> groovy SomeScript.groovy
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><strong>Linux installation</strong></p>

<p>Most Linux distributions provide Groovy through their integrated
package management system. On Debian(and derivatives like Ubuntu) you
can install it like this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="gp">$</span> sudo apt-get install groovy
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>On Red Hat systems the magic incantation looks like this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="gp">$</span> sudo yum install groovy
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Personally I’d prefer the platform-independent installation method,
since some distribution package Groovy in a non-standard manner which
confuses IDEs for instance.</p>

<h1 id="meet-groovy">Meet Groovy</h1>

<p><em>“Groovy is like a super version of Java. It can leverage Java’s
enterprise capabilities but also has cool productivity features like
closures, builders and dynamic typing. If you are a developer, tester
or script guru, you have to love Groovy.”</em> - praise for Groovy from
<a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/">http://groovy.codehaus.org/</a></p>

<p>Groovy is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is one of the two standard languages for the JVM(the other is Java
of course)</li>
  <li>is an agile and dynamic language for the Java Virtual Machine</li>
  <li>builds upon the strengths of Java but has additional power features inspired by languages like Python, Ruby and Smalltalk</li>
  <li>makes modern programming features available to Java developers with almost-zero learning curve</li>
  <li>supports Domain-Specific Languages and other compact syntax so your
code becomes easy to read and maintain </li>
  <li>makes writing shell and build scripts easy with its powerful processing primitives, OO abilities and an Ant DSL</li>
  <li>increases developer productivity by reducing scaffolding code when developing web, GUI, database or console applications</li>
  <li>simplifies testing by supporting unit testing and mocking out-of-the-box</li>
  <li>seamlessly integrates with all existing Java classes and libraries</li>
  <li>compiles straight to Java bytecode so you can use it anywhere you
can use Java</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of Groovy’s most compelling features are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pure OOP language</li>
  <li>Mostly Java compatible syntax</li>
  <li>Optional typing</li>
  <li>No need to wait for a future version of Java to get:
    <ul>
      <li>Closures</li>
      <li>Attributes</li>
      <li>Smart switch</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Duck typing</li>
  <li>BigInteger based arithmetic(integer calculations in Groovy are
automatically promoted to BigInteger when necessary)</li>
  <li>SQL, XML &amp; Swing improvements</li>
  <li>Unified data access API</li>
</ul>

<p>A core idea, guiding the design of Groovy, is making it easy to use for
existing Java developers. Groovy’s designers have gone so far in that
direction that the Groovy compiler will happily compile most Java
source files without the need for any modifications. Groovy, however,
builds heavily upon the standard Java’s syntax and you’ll do well to
get a grip of Groovy’s core idioms. Groovy’s syntax in a nutshell:</p>

</div>

<p>From the brief overview you might have noticed that like Ruby and
Python Groovy has language support for commonly used data structures
such as lists, maps, ranges and regular expressions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>List - def number = [1, 2, 3]</li>
  <li>Map - def countries = [BG: “Bulgaria”, DE: “Germany]</li>
  <li>Range - def range = 1..1000 </li>
  <li>Regular expressions - def whitespace = /\s+/</li>
</ul>

<p>You might have noticed another interesting feature in Groovy - the
ability to combine static type(like in Java) with dynamic typing(like
in Ruby and Python). The keyword <em>def</em> is used to introduce
dynamically typed variables in Groovy.</p>

<p>Groovy comes with its very own standard library(GDK) which builds upon
the JDK(for instance the File and String classes are enhanced in
Groovy) and offer some new features like the Groovy’s famous builders.</p>

<h1 id="oop-in-groovy">OOP in Groovy</h1>

<p>Groovy is a pure object oriented language. Everything is an object,
operations are methods, etc. Compared the Java the picture looks right
about this way:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Similar capabilities to Java
    <ul>
      <li>Define classes, interfaces, enums, annotations</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Differences to Java
    <ul>
      <li>Classes (and interfaces etc.) public by default</li>
      <li>Methods public by default</li>
      <li>Property support within classes (auto-setters/getters)</li>
      <li>Duck typing</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Java developers should feel mostly at home.</p>

<h1 id="sql-and-xml-handling">SQL and XML handling</h1>

<p>Groovy offers some nice improvements over JDBC and JAXP for handling
database queries and XML parsing.</p>

<p>Groovy removes a lot of boilerplate when dealing with SQL queries
compared to the native JDBC API:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="groovy"><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">groovy.sql.Sql</span>
<span class="n">sql</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Sql</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">newInstance</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;jdbc:mysql://host/db&quot;</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;username&quot;</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;password&quot;</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;com.mysql.jdbc.Driver&quot;</span><span class="o">)</span>
<span class="n">sql</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">eachRow</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;select * from tableName&quot;</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="o">{</span> <span class="n">println</span> <span class="n">it</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">id</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s">&quot; -- ${it.firstName} --&quot;</span><span class="o">}</span> <span class="o">)</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This code is written for a connection to a MySQL database. You will
need to adjust all the parameters to newInstance to connect to your
database, especially username and password.  Finally the third line
calls the eachRow method of sql, passing in two arguments, the first
being the query string, the second being a closure to print out some
values.  Notice that in the closure the fields of “it” are accessed in
two different ways. The first is as a simple field reference,
accessing the id field of it. The second is the included Groovy
expression mentioned above.</p>

<p>So the output from a row might look like:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="go">1 -- Bozhidar --</span>
<span class="go">2 -- Maya --</span>
<span class="go">3 -- Kate --</span>
<span class="go">4 -- Valentine --</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>XML processing is common enough task in computing and Groovy’s
developers tried to make it simple and straightforward as
possible. Let’s parse the following file:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="xml"><span class="nt">&lt;books&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;book&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;title&gt;</span>Dune<span class="nt">&lt;/title&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;author</span> <span class="na">firstname=</span><span class="s">&quot;Frank&quot;</span> <span class="na">lastname=</span><span class="s">&quot;Herbert&quot;</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/book&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;book&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;title&gt;</span>Dune Messiah<span class="nt">&lt;/title&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;author</span> <span class="na">firstname=</span><span class="s">&quot;Frank&quot;</span> <span class="na">lastname=</span><span class="s">&quot;Herbert&quot;</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/book&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;book&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;title&gt;</span>Children of Dune<span class="nt">&lt;/title&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;author</span> <span class="na">firstname=</span><span class="s">&quot;Frank&quot;</span> <span class="na">lastname=</span><span class="s">&quot;Herbert&quot;</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>

    <span class="nt">&lt;book&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;title&gt;</span>A Game of Thrones<span class="nt">&lt;/title&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;author</span> <span class="na">firstname=</span><span class="s">&quot;George&quot;</span> <span class="na">lastname=</span><span class="s">&quot;Martin&quot;</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/book&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/books&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>All the code we need to write is:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="groovy"><span class="kt">def</span> <span class="n">books</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">XmlSlurper</span><span class="o">().</span><span class="na">parse</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;books.xml&quot;</span><span class="o">)</span>

    <span class="n">println</span> <span class="s">&quot;Title = ${it.title}, Author: ${it.author.@firstname} ${it.author.@lastname}&quot;</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Ruby and Python developers probably aren’t particularly impressed, but
I can only imagine the look on the faces of Java developers that are
generally required to write huge amount of boilerplate code when
dealing with XML.</p>

<h1 id="builders">Builders</h1>

<p>Groovy has special syntax support for List and Maps. This is great
because it gives a concise representation of the actual object being
defined, so its easier to keep track of what a program or script is
doing. But what about programs which contain arbitrary nested tree
structures. Surely, they are the hardest ones to keep track of what is
going on. Isn’t that an area where syntactic help will be most
beneficial?</p>

<p>The answer is definitely yes and Groovy comes to the party with its
builder concept. You can use it for DOM-like APIs or Ant tasks or
Jelly tags or Swing widgets or whatever. Each may have their own
particular factory mechanism to create the tree of objects - however
they can share the same builder syntax to define them - in a concise
alternative to XML or lengthy programming code.</p>

<p>One use for builders is the generation of markup:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="groovy"><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">groovy.xml.*</span>

<span class="kt">def</span> <span class="n">page</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">MarkupBuilder</span><span class="o">()</span>
<span class="n">page</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">html</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="n">head</span> <span class="o">{</span> <span class="n">title</span> <span class="err">&#39;</span><span class="n">Hello</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">Groovy</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="err">&#39;</span> <span class="o">}</span>
    <span class="n">body</span> <span class="o">{</span>
        <span class="n">div</span> <span class="o">{</span>
            <span class="mi">3</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">times</span> <span class="o">{</span>
                <span class="n">p</span> <span class="s">&quot;Groovy power!&quot;</span>
            <span class="o">}</span>
        <span class="o">}</span>
    <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Result:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="html"><span class="nt">&lt;html&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;head&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;title&gt;</span>Hello, Groovy!<span class="nt">&lt;/title&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/head&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;body&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;div&gt;</span>
      <span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>Groovy power!<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
      <span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>Groovy power!<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
      <span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>Groovy power!<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/body&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/html&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Builders can also be used to create Swing GUIs. Here’s a very small example:</p>

<h1 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h1>

<p>Groovy is a language aiming to bring dynamic productivity to Java
developer without introducing them to a steep learning curve. The
language is beautifully architectured and integrates seamlessly with
the existing Java libraries and infrastructure. My biggest gripe with
Groovy was the lack of advanced support for parallel and concurrent
programming. A few days before I wrote this article, however, Groovy
1.8.0 was released and it features the excellent library for parallel
programming <a href="http://gpars.codehaus.org/">GPars</a>. Groovy’s performance
is not stellar at this point, but I guess
this will be improved upon in Java 7. </p>

<p>With its easy to grasp Java-like syntax Groovy is a solid contender
for the attention of Java developers. A growing number of Groovy
related job offerings is a sign of Groovy’s acceptance as a industrial
strength tool. </p>

<p>Some people criticize Groovy for the lack of innovation and claim that
it’s simply an amalgam of ideas borrowed from other languages. I don’t
see nothing bad with that approach as long as the features are
tastefully combined. Groovy might not be the most elegant language out
there, but it’s one of the most practical ones and will help you get
the job done.</p>

<h2 id="lisp-problems20110504lisp-problemshtml"><a href="/2011/05/04/lisp-problems.html">Lisp Problems</a></h2>
<p>This is a remake of the P-99: Ninety-Nine Prolog Problems collection
that Werner Hett assembled over several years of teaching at the University of
Applied Sciences (Berner Fachhochschule) at Biel-Bienne,
Switzerland. The collection is structured into seven sections. I have
renumbered the problems in order to get more freedom to rearrange
things within the sections.</p>

<p>The purpose of this problem collection is to give you the opportunity
to practice your skills in logic programming. Your goal should be to
find the most elegant solution of the given problems. Efficiency is
important, but logical clarity is even more crucial. Some of the
(easy) problems can be trivially solved using built-in
functions. However, in these cases, you learn more if you try to find
your own solution.</p>

<p>The problems have different levels of difficulty. Those marked with a
single asterisk (*) are easy. If you have successfully solved the
preceeding problems you should be able to solve them within a few (say
15) minutes. Problems marked with two asterisks (**) are of
intermediate difficulty. If you are a skilled Prolog programmer it
shouldn’t take you more than 30-90 minutes to solve them. Problems
marked with three asterisks (***) are more difficult. You may need
more time (i.e. a few hours or more) to find a good solution.</p>

<p><strong>1.28 (**) Sorting a list of lists according to length of sublists</strong>

<p>b) Again, we suppose that a list (InList) contains elements that are lists themselves. But this time the objective is to sort the elements of InList according to their length frequency; i.e. in the default, where sorting is done ascendingly, lists with rare lengths are placed first, others with a more frequent length come later.</p>

<p>Note that in the above example, the first two lists in the result L have length 4 and 1, both lengths appear just once. The third and forth list have length 3; there are two list of this length. And finally, the last three lists have length 2. This is the most frequent length. </p>

dynamic language. I personally know them both(though I know a bit more
Ruby, than Python) and in this article I’ll share my personal opinion
on their strengths and weaknesses. You’d probably do good to learn
them both, but my arguments here may lead you to pick only one of the
languages depending on you preferences.</p>

<h1 id="installation">Installation</h1>

<p><strong>Linux/Unix installation</strong></p>

<p>If you’re using a Linux distribution or some other Unix derivative
such as *BSD or Solaris you’ll probably be able to install Ruby and
Python through the operating system’s software management system. For
instance on Debian Linux systems(Ubuntu is a popular Debian
derivative) you can use apt to install them. Run the following
commands as root or with sudo:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="gp">$</span> apt-get install ruby
<span class="gp">$</span> apt-get install python
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>On Red Hat based distros like Fedora, CentOS, etc you can use yum
instead:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="gp">$</span> yum install ruby
<span class="gp">$</span> yum install python
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You should keep in mind the fact that both Ruby and Python have two
version that are commonly used at the moment. Ruby’s current version
is <em>1.9.2</em> and Python’s is <em>3.2</em>. For various reasons(like backward
compatibility for instance), however, the current versions are not
widely deployed yet(especially Python 3). In most Linux distributions
the package ruby will actually be Ruby 1.8.x and the package python
will be Python 2.7.x. If your distribution is one of those - look for
packages named ruby19(or similar) and python3:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="gp">$</span> apt-get install ruby19
<span class="gp">$</span> apt-get install python3
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>or:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="gp">$</span> apt-get install ruby19
<span class="gp">$</span> apt-get install python3
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Using the distribution package management system is a simple solution,
but in the case of Ruby it might not be best one. Most Ruby hackers
favour a powerful bash script called RVM(Ruby Version Manager) that
allows you to install several different version(or flavours of Ruby)
and switch easily between them. Please refer to the official
<a href="https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/">RVM documentation</a> for installation
and usage instructions.</p>

<p><strong>Windows installation</strong></p>

<p>Installing Ruby on Windows used to be a pretty hard task, but this is
no longer the case now thanks to
<a href="http://rubyinstaller.org/">the RubyInstaller for Windows</a>. This is a
self-contained Windows-based installer that includes the Ruby
language, an execution environment, important documentation, and
more. It has two editions one for the older 1.8.x Ruby branch and one
for the current 1.9.x.</p>

<p>Python has several installation options for Windows - the most obvious
being the
<a href="http://python.org/ftp/python/3.2/python-3.2.msi">official Python installer for Windows</a>. <a href="http://www.activestate.com/activepython">ActiveState’s ActivePython</a>
is another popular option packed with more features, but you should
keep in mind that although the Community Edition is free ActivePython
is not an open-source project. Personally I prefer ActivePython. Other
prebuilt Python binaries for Windows are also available, but are not
commonly used.</p>

<p><strong>OS X installation</strong></p>

<p>Ruby is generally preinstalled on OSX, but OSX users can also install
it via <a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/">homebrew</a> or RVM(as mentioned in the Linux section).</p>

<p>The is an official <a href="http://python.org/ftp/python/3.2/python-3.2-macosx10.6.dmg">Python package for OSX</a> available. Most users
will probably prefer using homebrew, however.</p>

<h1 id="syntax--code-structure">Syntax &amp; code structure</h1>

<p>Ruby makes heavy use of braces and keywords(like do/then/end) to
delimit blocks of code. Python relies simply on indentation. </p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="python"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">fact</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nb">reduce</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">))</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Same thing in Ruby:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">fact</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">.n</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">reduce</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:*</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>I personally prefer the Python approach since it enforces the code
semantics based on the code structure alone without imposing special
syntax.</p>

<p>As a side node you might take under consideration that the Ruby method
definition doesn’t have an explicit return value. The value of the
last expression in the method’s body becomes automatically the
method’s return value. Lisp developers will find this familiar. Java
and C# developers will probably find it a bit confusing. There is a
<em>return</em> in Ruby, though, it’s just rarely used.</p>

<p>Both languages have support for nested function definitions. </p>

<p>Both languages have support for “top-level” functions - that live(or
seem to live) outside classes and modules(something not possible in
Java for instance). This makes them good for general purpose
scripting. While I would still prefer to do my system administration
with shell and Perl scripts - Ruby and Python offer a solid
alternative. Python has a richer system administration library so I’d
prefer it over Ruby for such tasks. </p>

<p>Ruby has a lot of crust(“heritage”) from Perl - like a myriad of
special variables that are now more or less deprecated. It also has
much syntactic sugar - for instance do/end is commonly replaced by {}
for blocks that are only one line long, there is special syntax for
hashtables, whose keys are symbols, etc. </p>

<p>Since special symbols(non alphanumeric) are allowed in Ruby
identifiers Ruby uses them to impose some naming conventions to make
the source code a bit more readable in certain scenarios - for
instance predicate methods(those that return true or false) have names
that end with ?(usually) like even?, odd?, prime?, etc. Methods that
mutate the object on which they were invoked generally have the !
suffix - sort!, map!, etc. I find this a nice decision. In Ruby you
generally have many ways to achieve the same result:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="irb"><span class="go">ruby-1.9.2-p0 &gt; 1.even?</span>
<span class="go"> =&gt; false </span>
<span class="go">ruby-1.9.2-p0 &gt; arr = [1, 2, 3]</span>
<span class="go"> =&gt; [1, 2, 3] </span>
<span class="go">ruby-1.9.2-p0 &gt; arr.map { |x| x * 2 }</span>
<span class="go"> =&gt; [2, 4, 6] </span>
<span class="go">ruby-1.9.2-p0 &gt; arr</span>
<span class="go"> =&gt; [1, 2, 3] </span>
<span class="go">ruby-1.9.2-p0 &gt; arr.map! { |x| x * 2 }</span>
<span class="go"> =&gt; [2, 4, 6] </span>
<span class="go">ruby-1.9.2-p0 &gt; arr</span>
<span class="go"> =&gt; [2, 4, 6] </span>
<span class="go">ruby-1.9.2-p0 &gt; (1..5).reduce(:*)</span>
<span class="go"> =&gt; 120 </span>
<span class="go">ruby-1.9.2-p0 &gt; (1..5).reduce { |x, y| x * y }</span>
<span class="go"> =&gt; 120 </span>
<span class="go">ruby-1.9.2-p0 &gt; (1..5).reduce do |x, y|</span>
<span class="go">ruby-1.9.2-p0 &gt;     x * y</span>
<span class="go">ruby-1.9.2-p0 ?&gt;  end</span>
<span class="go"> =&gt; 120 </span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>No such things in Python, however. Python’s philosophy is one of
simplicity - no excessive syntax sugar, one true way of doing things.</p>

<p>Both languages have powerful features for organising code in
libraries. I would not go into any details on the subject here, but
I’ll share with you the fact that I like Python’s more.</p>

<p>Both languages come with a REPL in which you can do some exploratory
programming. Ruby’s REPL(irb)  allows you
to do TAB smart completion(amongst other things) by default. To get
TAB completion in the Python REPL you’d have to execute this bit of
code first:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="pycon"><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">readline</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="nn">rlcompleter</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">readline</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">parse_and_bind</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;tab: complete&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Alternative you can just stick this code snippet in the
<strong>~/.pythonrc.py</strong> file(create it if it doesn’t exist). If you are using
Windows adjust accordingly(you will have to figure out where
pythonrc.py is located there).</p>

<p>Ruby does not have statements - only expressions. This
basically means that everything(objects, method calls) evaluate to
some value(though the value might not be helpful always). </p>

<p>In Python there are some statements such as assignment and <em>if</em>. One
thing I dislike about the Python REPL is that it doesn’t print None
values. Compare this bit of Python code:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="pycon"><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;this is a test&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">this is a test</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>to this Ruby snippet:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="irb"><span class="go">ruby-1.9.2-p0 &gt; puts &quot;this is a test&quot;</span>
<span class="go">this is a test</span>
<span class="go"> =&gt; nil </span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>In the Python version we see only the side-effect(the printing), but
not the return value.</p>

<p>Python also ships with a minimalistic IDE called IDLE. If you don’t
have it by default after a python installation on Linux probably
you’re vendor decided to package IDLE as a separate package. IDLE
offers basic features like syntax highlighting, code completion and
integration with a debugger. It’s a good tool for exploratory
programming, but I advise you to pick another tool for serious development.</p>

<h1 id="naming-conventions">Naming conventions</h1>
<p>The naming conventions for both Ruby and Python are mostly the same
which is good if you’re using them both on a daily basis - less room
for confusion.</p>

<ul>
  <li>variable and method names consisting of more then one word are
written in lowercase with underscores separating the individual
words like_this.</li>
  <li>Class names start with capital letter and follow the camel case
naming convention LikeThis. Some of Python’s core classes, however,
violate this convention.</li>
  <li>Constants are generally written in all caps with underscores
separating the individual words LIKE_THIS.</li>
</ul>

<p>As I mentioned earlier it’s customary to add ? as a suffix to
predicate methods and ! to mutator methods in Ruby. This convention is
not always followed unfortunately, even in Ruby’s standard library.</p>

<h1 id="oop-support">OOP support</h1>
<p>Both Ruby and Python are famous members of the family of object
oriented languages. Unlike languages such as Java and C#, however,
Ruby and Python are pure OOP languages. There is no distinction
between primitive types(such as numbers, characters and booleans) and
reference types(classes). Everything in them is an object and in that
sense it’s an instance of some class:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="pycon"><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="nb">type</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">&lt;type &#39;int&#39;&gt;</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="nb">type</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;string&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">&lt;type &#39;str&#39;&gt;</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="nb">type</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mf">20.07</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">&lt;type &#39;float&#39;&gt;</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="nb">type</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">])</span>
<span class="go">&lt;type &#39;list&#39;&gt;</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="nb">type</span><span class="p">((</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="go">&lt;type &#39;tuple&#39;&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>And in Ruby:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="irb"><span class="go">ruby-1.9.2-p0 &gt; 10.class</span>
<span class="go"> =&gt; Fixnum </span>
<span class="go">ruby-1.9.2-p0 &gt; &quot;string&quot;.class</span>
<span class="go"> =&gt; String </span>
<span class="go">ruby-1.9.2-p0 &gt; [].class</span>
<span class="go"> =&gt; Array </span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>As you can see core Ruby classes tend to have a bit more standard and
descriptive names than their Python counterparts. You can also notice
that in Python for some task we use built-in functions like type,
instead of method calls. The built-in function will eventually result
in a method invocation(like “string”.<strong>class</strong> in the case of
type(“string”)), but I find this irregularity in the syntax a bit
irritating.</p>

<p>Method invocation is more flexible in Ruby - you can omit braces in
some scenarios. This is handy when you’re designing a DSL or you’re
trying to implement the uniform access patterns(data should be
accessed through fields and methods in the same manner(read this as
with no braces in method invocations)). On the other hand Python’s
uniform syntax makes it easier to spot method invocations. </p>

<p>Both languages don’t have operators - just methods. Ruby’s OO support
seems to be a bit more mature and polished(at least to me), but
Python’s has some touches as well. I particularly like the explicit
self references that are required when you try to access class
members. I’m not too found of the use of special sigils in Ruby to
mark instance(@) and class members(@@). Though they make them visually
distinctive I think we could have lived without them - I’m generally
not a fan of non-uniform syntax rules(and you guessed it - my
favourite language is Lisp).</p>

<p>Ruby’s metaprogramming model arguably gives it an edge in the OOP
department, but I won’t be discussing the metaprogramming issues here
since they are quite lengthy.</p>

<h1 id="functional-programming-support">Functional programming support</h1>

<p>Functional programming has been on the rise lately and it’s useful to
examine what kind of support both languages provide for it. Both have
support for lambda functions and respectively - higher-order
functions(functions that accept functions as parameters). Ruby has
code blocks, Python has list comprehensions(generally favoured over
higher-order functions). Both languages lack in their standard libs
the immutable data structures that generally are the code of most
functional programming languages. Here’s a few example related to
filtering a sequence based on some predicate:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="pycon"><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="nb">filter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">11</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="go">[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">11</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="go">[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Ruby:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="irb"><span class="go">ruby-1.9.2-p0 &gt; (1..10).select { |x| x.even? }</span>
<span class="go"> =&gt; [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] </span>
<span class="go">ruby-1.9.2-p0 &gt; (1..10).select &amp;:even?</span>
<span class="go"> =&gt; [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] </span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Ruby’s functional programming support seems to be better to me, but
this is of course subjective.</p>

<h1 id="gui-programming">GUI programming</h1>

<p>Python has tkinker by default - a wrapper around the Tk library(which
sucks in my humble opinion). Ruby doesn’t have even this much. Both
have binding for the popular GUI toolkits such wxwidgets, GTK,
QT. From my experimentation with them I can tell you that you’ll be
much better off with Python in that department. It’s not wonder that
many GTK+ applications these days are implemented in Python. Most Ruby
bindings projects seem to be in a state of disarray, abandonment - I
guess we have to thank Rails for that. Most people think of Rails as
the only use of Ruby which is sad…</p>

<p>Ruby devs shouldn’t despair however. JRuby(Ruby’s port to the JVM) has
an excellent support for the superb Swing GUI framework and MacRuby
has great support for building Cocoa Apps for OS X. I personally think
that JRuby is the best Ruby distribution out there, but that’s the
point of another post entirely.</p>

<h1 id="rd-party-library-availability-and-installation">3rd party library availability and installation</h1>

<p>It’s not secret that part of Python’s philosophy is that it comes with
batteries included - meaning that it’s standard library is vast and
covers a lot of common tasks. In case you can’t find what you’re
looking for in it you’re left with an number of third party libraries
for Python whose number can only be described by the word epic and
that cover every task conceivable. <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi">PyPi</a>
maintains an up-to-date list of Python packages.</p>

<p>You have several options in the department of python package
management. If you’re using ActivePython you can use the excellent
<a href="http://code.activestate.com/pypm/">PyPM</a> tool, which provides quick
installation of thousands of packages for many Python versions and
platforms for ActivePython distributions.</p>

<p><a href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall">EasyInstall</a> is another popular solution that works with the standard
Python distribution. Like PyPM it allows you easily search for and
install Python packages from the PyPI that are bundled in Python’s
standard egg format(Jave developers might think of eggs as
jars). EasyInstall has splendid documentation so I won’t go into any
details here.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/index.html">pip</a> is a
replacement for easy_install. It uses mostly the same techniques for
finding packages, so packages that were made easy_installable should
be pip-installable as well.</p>

<p>pip is meant to improve on EasyInstall. Some of the improvements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All packages are downloaded before installation. Partially-completed installation doesn’t occur as a result.</li>
  <li>Care is taken to present useful output on the console.</li>
  <li>The reasons for actions are kept track of. For instance, if a package is being installed, pip keeps track of why that package was required.</li>
  <li>Error messages should be useful.</li>
  <li>The code is relatively concise and cohesive, making it easier to use programmatically.</li>
  <li>Packages don’t have to be installed as egg archives, they can be installed flat (while keeping the egg metadata).</li>
  <li>Native support for other version control systems (Git, Mercurial and Bazaar)</li>
  <li>Uninstallation of packages.</li>
  <li>Simple to define fixed sets of requirements and reliably reproduce a set of packages.</li>
</ul>

<p>pip doesn’t do everything that easy_install does. Specifically:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It cannot install from eggs. It only installs from source. (In the future it would be good if it could install binaries from Windows .exe or .msi – binary install on other platforms is not a priority.)</li>
  <li>It doesn’t understand Setuptools extras (like package[test]). This should be added eventually.</li>
  <li>It is incompatible with some packages that extensively customize distutils or setuptools in their setup.py files.</li>
</ul>

<p>Linux users will also find a great selection of Python libraries
prepackaged for use with the distribution’s package manager.</p>

<p>Ruby has an application that is more or less equivalent to EasyInstall
called <a href="http://rubygems.org/">RubyGems</a>(gems are the standard way to distribute Ruby
libraries). Linux users can of course install Ruby libraries with the
distribution’s package manager as well. </p>

<p>RubyGems has the following features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Easy Installation and removal of RubyGems packages and their dependents.</li>
  <li>Management and control of local packages</li>
  <li>Package dependency management</li>
  <li>Query, search and list local and remote packages</li>
  <li>Multiple version support for installed packages</li>
  <li>Web-based interface to view the documentation for your installed gems</li>
  <li>Easy to use interface for building gem packages</li>
  <li>Simple server for distributing your own gem packages</li>
  <li>Easy to use building and publishing of gem packages</li>
</ul>

<p>Using RubyGems, you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>download and install Ruby libraries easily</li>
  <li>not worry about libraries A and B depending on different versions of library C</li>
  <li>easily remove libraries you no longer use</li>
  <li>have power and control over your Ruby platform! </li>
</ul>

<p>A reader pointed out that about 23000 packages are available for
installation through RubyGems and 15000 through PyPI. This, however,
cannot be considered as a certain sign that there are more libraries
available for Ruby than for Python.</p>

<p>Although tools like EasyInstall and RubyGems are easy to use and quite
handy, I as a long-time Linux users dislike them a bit, since they
circumvent the distributions native package handling. Unfortunately
package maintainers cannot find the time to package every Python and
Ruby library available so I guess EasyInstall and RubyGems won’t be
going anywhere soon and of course we have to consider Windows users
for whom such applications are of great value given the lack of
unified package management on Windows.</p>

<p>One thing to keep in mind about installing eggs and gems is that some
of them are implemented in C(usually for performance reasons) and are
locally built prior to their installation - an operation bound to fail
if you don’t have a C compiler installed.</p>

<h1 id="misc">Misc</h1>

<p>In terms of performance of the default interpreters CPython and MRI
Ruby Python is the clear winner. One should note, however, is that there
are many how quality implementation of Ruby and Python for different
platforms where the performance situation differs wildly. For instance
Jython is much slower that JRuby. With the addition of invoke_dynamic
in JDK7(basically bytecode level support for dynamic method dispatch)
the performance of JRuby and Jython could potentially be improved
greatly.</p>

<p>In terms of overall usage, market share, job offers and sheer size of
the community and available libraries Python is ahead of Ruby as
well. One of the main supporters of Python is after all none other
than the mighty Google. Ruby has also the unfortunate luck to be
living in the shadow of a single application written in Ruby - Ruby on
Rails, that is arguably more popular than the language itself.</p>

<p>Tooling for dynamic languages is currently not as advance as the one
for static languages. People often joke that Python(Ruby) &gt; Java(C#),
but Python + any python IDE &lt; Java + IntelliJ
IDEA(Eclipse/NetBeans). Python and Ruby IDEs seem to be mostly on par
currently. I do all of my Ruby and Python coding in Emacs, but I do
like RubyMine and PyCharm. </p>

<p>Since they are often used for the creation of webapps one should
consider the deployment issue. Most web hosting companies provide
cheap Python hosting, but very few companies provide Ruby hosting.</p>

<h1 id="the-python-3-problem">The Python 3 problem</h1>

<p>Python 3 was a great undertaking that improved on a lot of aspects of
the language(for example Unicode support) and the standard library. To
do this it dropped backward compatibility, an act that slowed it’s
adoption immensely. Three years have passed since it’s release and
still most hosting providers, Linux distros and Python projects hold
on to the older 2.7.x Python branch.</p>

<p>This is a bit of tragedy since Python 3 is truly a great improvement
over Python 2. I mention this because most recent books are written
with Python 3 in mind, but if you land a Python jobs somewhere chances
are you’ll have to use Python 2.x.x for the foreseeable future.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>Ruby and Python are two beautifully engineered languages capable of
just about everything. If you don’t know any of them you’ll do well to
learn at least one. If you know only one it might not be a terrible
idea to learn the other.</p>

<p>I haven’t touched on many language features(like Python generators and
Ruby mixins), but to be honest I’m just tired of typing. One good
place to start your journey to Python is
<a href="http://diveintopython3.org/">“Dive into Python 3”</a>. For Ruby
beginners I’d recommend a copy of
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ruby-Programming-Language-David-Flanagan/dp/0596516177">“The Ruby Programming Language”</a>.</p>

<p><em>P.S. If you like exploring different programming languages and you’re
currently shopping for ideas on the subject of which language to learn
next you might find my recent article

<h2 id="parsing-numbers-from-string-in-common-lisp20110430parsing-numbers-from-string-in-lisphtml"><a href="/2011/04/30/parsing-numbers-from-string-in-lisp.html">Parsing numbers from string in Common Lisp</a></h2>
<p>One task that often recurs in programming is the need to parse a
string representation a number(or several numbers) and convert it to
its numeric value. Parsing integer value in Common Lisp is fairly
straightforward process - we have the built-in function <strong>PARSE-INTEGER</strong>:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="cl"><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">parse-integer</span> <span class="s">&quot;100&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1">;; =&gt; 100</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">parse-integer</span> <span class="s">&quot;100&quot;</span> <span class="ss">:radix</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1">;; =&gt; 4</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>As you can see the function allows you to parse a string
representation of a number in an arbitrary base system(the default is
the <em>decimal</em>). With the keyword argument <strong>:radix</strong> you can specify a
base in the interval 2-36. The function has a few other fancy
capabilities as well - like the ability to process only a part of the
string that has been passed to it and to ignore junk in the input
string. For all the gory details refer to the
<a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_parse_.htm">Lisp HyperSpec</a>.</p>

<p>The problem that most Lisper face soon after is that there is no
matching function PARSE-FLOAT or PARSE-DOUBLE. I’m not sure what
technical reason is hidden beneath this design decision, but I know of
simple way to parse floating point numbers non-the-less. It’s built
around the <strong>READ</strong>(The R in REPL) function that allows you read any
S-expression from a string form. The READ function then returns a Lisp
object corresponding to the S-expression read. With that knowledge and
the fact that READ accepts as an optional argument an input stream
from which to read that S-expression(the default is the the standard
input) we can write the following bit of parsing code:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="cl"><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">with-input-from-string</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">in</span> <span class="s">&quot;3.14&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">read</span> <span class="nv">in</span><span class="p">))</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Here we created an input stream that’s bound to the string “3.14” and
read one S-expression from it - the floating point object 3.14.</p>

<p>We can even build a more general solution that parses several numbers
in a string, regardless of their actual type(integer or floating
point):</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="cl"><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">with-input-from-string</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">in</span> <span class="s">&quot;3.14 5.646 4 9.6&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">loop</span> <span class="nv">for</span> <span class="nv">x</span> <span class="nb">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">read</span> <span class="nv">in</span> <span class="no">nil</span> <span class="no">nil</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="nv">while</span> <span class="nv">x</span> <span class="nv">collect</span> <span class="nv">x</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="c1">;; =&gt; (3.14 5.646 4 9.6)</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Hopefully this short article has been helpful. You’ve also witnessed
one of the practical benefits of having the code in Lisp represented
as data.</p>

<h2 id="one-shell-to-rule-them-all20110429one-shell-to-rule-them-allhtml"><a href="/2011/04/29/one-shell-to-rule-them-all.html">One shell to rule them all…</a></h2>
<p>I’ve been using zsh for about three years now and continue to be
impressed the its immense power and flexibility. Switching from bash
to zsh was a decision as good as switching from Windows to GNU/Linux,
from vim to Emacs, from Eclipse to IntelliJ IDEA. In other words - it
was an extremely good decision. :-)</p>

<p>So I want to finally get the word out, showcase some nice zsh features
and probably persuade a couple of bash users to try it. Be warned,
however - after you try it there is no going back…</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>

<p>Most distros come with bash by default so you’ll probably need to
install zsh first and configure it as your user’s shell. On Fedora
you’d do:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="go">[bozhidar@bozhidar ~]$ sudo yum install zsh</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The edit /etc/password and set there zsh as your shell:</p>

<p>bozhidar:x:500:500:Bozhidar Batsov:/home/bozhidar:/bin/zsh</p>

<p>The next time you login a terminal wizard with start up asking you
about some basic zsh options that you might want to enable. I suggest
you to enable them all except the beep option. In the end the wizard
will save the new configuration to the file .zshrc in your user’s home
folder.</p>

<p>Alternatively you may just use a preconfigured .zshrc, like this one:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="c"># Lines configured by zsh-newuser-install</span>
<span class="nv">HISTFILE</span><span class="o">=</span>~/.histfile
<span class="nv">HISTSIZE</span><span class="o">=</span>1000
<span class="nv">SAVEHIST</span><span class="o">=</span>1000
setopt appendhistory autocd extendedglob nomatch notify correct_all
unsetopt beep
bindkey -e
<span class="c"># End of lines configured by zsh-newuser-install</span>
<span class="c"># The following lines were added by compinstall</span>
zstyle :compinstall filename <span class="s1">&#39;/home/bozhidar/.zshrc&#39;</span>

autoload -Uz compinit
compinit
<span class="c"># End of lines added by compinstall</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>I don’t like very much the default zsh prompt and I generally change
it right away. Have a look at my other
<a href="/2008/07/27/zsh-prompt.html">short article</a> on the topic.</p>

<p>There a couple of configuration files related to zsh that you should
know about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>.zshrc - runs for each new shell(roughly equivalent to .bashrc)</li>
  <li>.zprofile - runs only for login shells(like .bash_profile)</li>
  <li>.zlogout - runs on logout</li>
  <li>.zshenv - holds environmental variables</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s an example .zshenv file:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">JAVA_HOME</span><span class="o">=</span>/usr/java/latest

<span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">SCALA_HOME</span><span class="o">=</span>/opt/scala-2.8.1.final

<span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">M2_HOME</span><span class="o">=</span>/opt/apache-maven-3.0.2

<span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">EDITOR</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;emacsclient -t&quot;</span>
<span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">ALTERNATE_EDITOR</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;&quot;</span>

<span class="c">#needed to properly display complex color-themes in Emacs and vim</span>
<span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">TERM</span><span class="o">=</span>xterm-256color

<span class="nb">typeset</span> -U path
<span class="nv">path</span><span class="o">=(</span><span class="nv">$M2_HOME</span>/bin <span class="nv">$SCALA_HOME</span>/bin ~/bin ~/Projects/work/bin <span class="nv">$path</span><span class="o">)</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Please note the way in which the PATH variable is set in zsh, which
differs substantially from bash(it’s just exported there as any other variable).</p>

<h2 id="playing-around">Playing around</h2>

<p>At this point you have the legendary zsh autocompletion configured and
you have enabled many of the zsh core features.</p>

<p><strong>autocd</strong> allows you to navigate to folders only with their name
without the cd command. One of my favourite features. Now you can do
things like:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="go">  </span>
<span class="go">[bozhidar@bozhidar ~]$ Downloads   </span>
<span class="go">[bozhidar@bozhidar ~/Downloads]$</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Instead of:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="go">[bozhidar@bozhidar ~]$ cd Downloads   </span>
<span class="go">[bozhidar@bozhidar ~/Downloads]$</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>By the way autocd was added in bash 4.0 as well. You can enable it there with:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="go">[bozhidar@bozhidar ~]$ shopt -s autocd</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><strong>appendhistory</strong> all your open shells share the same history which is
handy if you want to refer commands from one shell in another with
say Ctrl+R(reverse-history-search)</p>

<p><strong>extendedglob</strong> allows you to recursive look for files in folders:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="go">[bozhidar@bozhidar ~]$ ls somedir/**/Makefile</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>is equivalent to:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="go">[bozhidar@bozhidar ~]$ find somedir -name Makefile</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Most zsh users never use find for simple file look up. This feature
was also added to bash 4.0 but it works in a slightly different
manner.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="gp">$</span> <span class="nb">shopt</span> -s extglob
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><strong>correct</strong> - autocorrects mistyped commands</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="go">[bozhidar@bozhidar]$ cta ~/.zshrc </span>
<span class="go">zsh: correct &#39;cta&#39; to &#39;cat&#39; [nyae]?</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<h1 id="keybindings">Keybindings</h1>

<p>By default zsh uses Emacs keybindings which is perfect for a long time
Emacs user like me. zsh doesn’t use readline, instead it has its own
line editing library called zle, which is much more powerful. vi users
are not forgotten and can switch zsh to vi keybindings with the
command:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="go">bindkey -v</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Mind that by default you’ll be in “insert” mode and have to press ESC
to go into command mode.</p>

<p>You can also create custom keybindings like this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="go">bindkey &#39;^[[H&#39; beginning-of-line</span>
<span class="go">bindkey &#39;^[[F&#39; end-of-line</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This will bind the Home and End keys to the commands beginning-of-line and end-of-line.
# Aliases</p>

<p>Zsh has three different kinds of shell aliases.</p>

<p><strong>Regular</strong> - same as in bash:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="go">alias ll=&#39;ls -l&#39;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><strong>Suffix</strong> - suffix aliases are supported in zsh since version
4.2.0. Some examples:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="go">alias -s tex=emacs</span>
<span class="go">alias -s html=google-chrome</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Now when you type in the console</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="gp">$</span> somefile.tex
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>it will be opened automatically with Emacs. Similarly somefile.html
would be opened by google-chrome. As you might imagine this feature is
quite handy.</p>

<p><strong>Global</strong> - global aliases can be used anywhere in the command line(as
opposed to regular aliases that can used only in the beginning). Example:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="go">alias -g ...=&#39;../..&#39;</span>
<span class="go">cd ...  </span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<h1 id="some-tips-and-tricks">Some tips and tricks</h1>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>press Alt+q in the middle of a command you’re typing. This will clear 
the console prompt and allow you execute another command(like a man lookup). Afterwards 
the things you’ve typed before the Alt+q will magically reappear.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Imagine you’re in the folder <strong>project/4.0/module</strong>. Typing:</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="go">cd 4.0 5.0 </span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Will take you to a folder named project/5.0/module(assuming that it exists of course). In general
the command has the format <code>cd old new</code>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>zsh comes with a built-in pager(similar to less). To try it just type &lt;somefilename. This is 
more or less equivalent to typing <code>less somefilename</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>There is no easy way to sum up everything that makes zsh great in a single blog post. I’ll try to
expand and improve it in time. I hope I’ve whetted your appetite to try out zsh. If you like it
well enough(of which I’m most certain you should have a look at the resources in the end as well).</p>
