<h2>Prelude</h2>

<p>Last month I've blogged about the
<a href="http://batsov.com/Emacs/2011/08/19/a-peek-at-emacs24.html">exciting things are coming up in Emacs 24</a>. What
I failed to mention originally is that altough Emacs 24 is slated for
a Spring 2012 (tentatively) release there is no real reason not to start using it
now. You should also keep in mind that it's feature complete since it
officially entered the feature freeze of its development cycle in July 2011.</p>

<p>I've been using Emacs 24 for several months now and it has been
nothing but rock solid. I guess the only real obstacle currently is
that the way to obtain Emacs 24 is not particularly straightfoward/clear,
hence this post.</p>

<p>I'll discuss here the installation and initial configuration of Emacs
24 on OSX, GNU/Linux and Windows.</p>

<h2>Installing Emacs 24</h2>

<h1>OS X</h1>

<p>Obtaining Emacs 24 on OS X is really simple. There are two popular
ways to do it. The first is to simply download a pretest (or a nightly
build) from <a href="http://emacsformacosx.com">Emacs for OSX</a>. My personal
recommendation would be to get the latest pretest (which is ironically
the first pretest as well) from
<a href="http://emacsformacosx.com/emacs-builds/Emacs-pretest-24.0.90-universal-10.6.7.dmg">here</a>.</p>

<p>That was really easy, right?</p>

<p>The second easy way to obtain Emacs 24 is via
<a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/">homebrew</a>. Just type the following
incantation in your shell and you're done:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="nv">$ </span>brew install emacs --cocoa --use-git-head --HEAD
<span class="nv">$ </span>cp -r /usr/local/Cellar/emacs/HEAD/Emacs.app /Applications/
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The second step is optional, but it's recommended if you like to start
Emacs from the launchpad or from Spotlight. Personally I prefer to
start Emacs in daemon mode (emacs --daemon), so that I could share a
single Emacs instance between several Emacs clients (emacsclient
-c/t).</p>

<p>That's all folk! You may now proceed to the configuration section.</p>

<h1>Linux</h1>

<p>Given that Linux is more or less the home os of Emacs it presents us
with the most installation options. Of course, we can build Emacs from
<a href="https://github.com/emacsmirror/emacs">source</a> on every distribution
out there, but I rarely bother to do so. Using the distribution's
package manager is a better idea for many reasons - you don't need to
install a build chain and lots of dev libraries, you get updated
versions when they are released and you get automated dependency
manager, just to name a few.</p>

<p>That said, few distributions include in their primary repositories
builds of Emacs 24. Luckily there are some unofficial repos that come
to the rescue.</p>

<p>Debian/Ubuntu users should look no further than the amazing
<a href="http://emacs.naquadah.org/">emacs-snapshot APT repo</a>. You'll find
installation instructions there for all the relevant Debian and Ubuntu
versions out there. High quality, highly recommended builds!</p>

<p>Gentoo users have even less to do, since Emacs 24 can be obtained via
the emacs-vcs package in portage, as noted in the official
<a href="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/lisp/emacs/emacs.xml">Emacs on Gentoo page</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I wasn't able to find prebuilt Emacs 24 packages for any
of the RPM distros (Fedora, SUSE, Mandriva, etc). Since, I'm Debian
user I have to admit that I didn't look that far, but the source
installation is not particularly hard and is always an option.</p>

<h1>Windows</h1>

<p>There are several ways to obtain precompiled Emacs 24 binaries if
you're a Windows users. The most popular are
<a href="http://ourcomments.org/cgi-bin/emacsw32-dl-latest.pl">EmacsW32</a>,
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/emacs-for-windows/">Emacs for Windows</a> and
of course the official
<a href="http://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/">Emacs Windows builds</a>. I've
,personally, never used any builds other than the official ones. The
unofficial builds usually include installers and various patches that
might be of use to some users.</p>

<p>Since I rarely use Windows I cannot give you any more advice on the
choice of a binary vendor.</p>

<h2>Initial configuration</h2>

<p>Installing Emacs has always been the easy part, configuring it
properly - not that much. That's why I've created the
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/emacs-prelude">Emacs Prelude</a> - an
advanced Emacs setup specifically for Emacs 24 that has been tested to
properly work on OSX, Linux and Windows.</p>

<p>Its installation is dead simple:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="nv">$ </span>git clone git://github.com/bbatsov/emacs-prelude.git path/to/local/repo
<span class="nv">$ </span>ln -s path/to/local/repo ~/.emacs.d
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>For Windows Vista/7 the ~(home) folder is
<strong>C:\Users&lt;USER&gt;\AppData\Roaming</strong>.</p>

<p>The configuration in the Prelude is commented extensively and will be
improved more along the way. Reading it will be an enlightening
experience for all new Emacs users.</p>

<p>The Prelude itself is a moving target. I've created it recently and I
plan to add a lot more cool things very soon, so stay tuned. If you
have any problems with it or have feature suggestions - do not
hesitate to open tickets and send pull requests. :-)</p>

<h2>Epilogue</h2>

<p>Now that I've shown you how easy it is to get a hold of Emacs 24 and
I've provided you with a starting configuration there is really no
excuse not to switch to Emacs 24. Install it, use it, love it!</p>

<h2><a href="/Programming/Ruby/2011/09/12/ruby-style-guide.html">The Totally Unofficial Ruby coding style guide</a></h2>

<h2>Prologue</h2>

<p>This document was created when I, as the Technical Lead of the company
in which I work for, was asked by the CTO to create some internal
documents describing good style and best practices for Ruby
programming. Since I didn't find any &quot;official&quot; coding guidelines I
started off by copying
<a href="https://github.com/chneukirchen/styleguide">this existing style guide</a>,
because I concurred with most of the points in it. Afterwards I
proceeded to built upon it and plan to improve it a lot more (the
examples now are totally superficial, but I'm quite busy these
days). I hope it will be useful to other people as well and I hope
that I'll get a lot of feedback and suggestions on how to improve the
guide for the benefit of the entire Ruby community.</p>

<h2>The Guide</h2>

<h1>Formatting</h1>

<ul>
<li>Use UTF-8 as the source file encoding.</li>
<li>Use 2 space indent, no tabs. (Your editor/IDE should have a setting to help you with that)</li>
<li>Use Unix-style line endings. (Linux/OSX users are covered by default, Windows users have to be extra careful)

<ul>
<li>if you're using Git you might want to do this <code>$ git config --global core.autocrlf true</code> to protect your project from Windows line endings creeping into your project</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Use spaces around operators, after commas, colons and semicolons, around { and before }.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Use RDoc and its conventions for API documentation.  Don't put an
empty line between the comment block and the <strong>def</strong>.</li>

<li>Keep lines fewer than 80 characters.

<h1>Syntax</h1>

<ul>

<p>a,b,c: any object
  d: directory names
  e: elements of an Enumerable
  ex: rescued exceptions
  f: files and file names
  i,j: indexes
  k: the key part of a hash entry

  o: any object
  r: return values of short methods
  s: strings
  v: any value

  x,y,z: numbers</p></li>

<p>And in general, the first letter of the class name if all objects are of that type.</p>

<ul>
<li>When using <strong>inject</strong> with short blocks, name the arguments <strong>|a, e|</strong> (mnemonic: accumulator, element)</li>
<li>When defining binary operators, name the argument &quot;other&quot;.</li>
</ul>

</code></pre>
</div>

<ul>
<li>Prefer <strong>map</strong> over <em>collect</em>, <strong>find</strong> over <em>detect</em>, <strong>find_all</strong> over <em>select</em>, <strong>size</strong> over <em>length</em>. This is not a hard requirement, though - if
the use of the alias enhances readability - it's ok to use it.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Comments</h1>

<ul>
<li>Write self documenting code and ignore the rest of this section.</li>
<li>Comments longer than a word are capitalized and use punctuation. Use two spaces after periods.</li>
<li>Avoid superfluous comments.</li>
<li>Keep existing comments up-to-date - no comment is better than an outdated comment.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Misc</h1>

<ul>
<li>Write <strong>ruby -w</strong> safe code.</li>
<li>Avoid hashes-as-optional-parameters.  Does the method do too much?</li>
<li>Avoid long methods (longer than 10 LOC). Ideally most methods will be shorter than 5 LOC. Empty line do not contribute to the relevant LOC.</li>
<li>Avoid long parameter lists (more than 3-4 params).</li>
<li>Use <strong>def self.method</strong> to define singleton methods. This makes the methods more resistent to refactoring changes.</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">TestClass</span>

</div>

<ul>
<li>Add &quot;global&quot; methods to Kernel (if you have to) and make them private.</li>
<li>Avoid <strong>alias</strong> when <strong>alias_method</strong> will do.</li>
<li>Use <strong>OptionParser</strong> for parsing complex command line options and
<strong>ruby -s</strong> for trivial command line options.</li>
<li>Write for Ruby 1.9. Don't use legacy Ruby 1.8 constructs.

<ul>
<li>use the new JavaScript literal hash syntax</li>
<li>use the new lambda syntax</li>
<li>methods like <strong>inject</strong> now accept method names as arguments - <code>[1, 2, 3].inject(:+)</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Avoid needless metaprogramming.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Design</h1>

<ul>
<li>Code in a functional way, avoid mutation when it makes sense.</li>
<li>Do not mutate arguments unless that is the purpose of the method.</li>
<li>Do not mess around in core classes when writing libraries. (do not monkey patch them)</li>
<li>Do not program defensively. See this <a href="http://www.erlang.se/doc/programming_rules.shtml#HDR11.">article</a> for more details.</li>
<li>Keep the code simple (subjective, but still...). Each method should have a single well-defined responsibility.</li>
<li>Avoid more than 3 levels of block nesting.</li>
<li>Don't overdesign. Overly complex solutions tend to be brittle and hard to maintain.</li>
<li>Don't underdesign. A solution to a problem should be as simple as
possible... but it should not be simpler than that. Poor initial design
can lead to a lot of problems in the future.</li>
<li>Be consistent. In an ideal world - be consistent with the points listed here in this guidelines.</li>
<li>Use common sense.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Overture</h2>

<p>I've created a <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide">GitHub project</a>, so that everyone can easily participate
in improving the quality of the guidelines. I hope that together we
could make a resource that will benefit the entire Ruby community. I
have a couple more guides like this one in the pipeline - one for
Rails and for testing Ruby and Rails applications.</p>

<p>If you're an Emacs user - the <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/emacs-prelude">Emacs Prelude</a> features
customizations that enforce some of the stuff outlined in the guide -
encoding, indentation, line length and lots of other goodies
(whitespace cleanup, ri integration, autopair for quotes, brackets,
etc, Ruby snippets, irb integration, git integration, haml, sass and
coffeescript support out of the box...). You
might want to check it out.</p>

<p><strong>P.S. The version of the Ruby style guide here is out of date. Please,

<h2><a href="/Emacs/2011/08/19/a-peek-at-emacs24.html">A peek at Emacs 24</a></h2>

<h2>Overture</h2>

<p>Recently I've decided to have a look at the current development
version of Emacs - namely Emacs 24. I was quite impressed with the work done
by the development team so far so I decided to share some of the cool things
I've found in Emacs 24.</p>

<p>It seems to me that this will be the most important Emacs release in
quite some time.</p>

<h2>Installation changes in Emacs 24</h2>

<p>There are a couple of new build flags support in Emacs 24 - most
notably there is GTK 3.0 support present. You can enable it by passing
the <strong>--with-x-toolkit=gtk3</strong> flag to <em>configure</em>. There is also built-in
support for selinux (that can be disabled at build time) and the
installed info and man pages are now compressed by default.</p>

<p>All in all - nothing major has changed with the installation process.</p>

<h2>General changes</h2>

<h1>Completion improvements</h1>

<p>There has been a lot of work done in the completion department. For
instance <strong>shell-mode</strong> now uses pcomplete rules and the standard
completion UI, which is pretty cool IMHO. Some other insteresting
improvements (mostly copied directly from Emacs' NEWS files):</p>

<ul>
<li>Many packages have been changed to use <em>completion-at-point</em> rather than
their own completion code.</li>
<li>Completion in a non-minibuffer now tries to detect the end of completion
and pops down the *Completions* buffer accordingly.</li>
<li>Completion can cycle, depending on completion-cycle-threshold.</li>
<li>There is a new completion style called <em>substring</em>.</li>
<li>Completion style can be set per-category with <em>completion-category-overrides</em>.</li>
<li>Completion of buffers now uses substring completion by default.</li>
<li><em>completing-read</em> can be customized using the new variable
<em>completing-read-function</em>.</li>
<li><em>minibuffer-local-filename-must-match-map</em> is not used any more.
Instead, the bindings in <em>minibuffer-local-filename-completion-map</em> are combined
with minibuffer-local-must-match-map.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Scrolling improvements</h1>

<p>Scrolling has always been a sour subject in Emacs. Emacs 24 finally
alleviates many of the long standing issues in the scrolling department:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>New scrolling commands <em>scroll-up-command</em> and <em>scroll-down-command</em>
(bound to C-v/[next] and M-v/[prior]) do not signal errors at top/bottom
of buffer at first key-press (instead move to top/bottom of buffer)
when a new variable <em>scroll-error-top-bottom</em> is non-nil.</p></li>
<li><p>New scrolling commands <em>scroll-up-line</em> and <em>scroll-down-line</em>
scroll a line instead of full screen.</p></li>
<li><p>New property <em>scroll-command</em> should be set on a command's symbol to
define it as a scroll command affected by <em>scroll-preserve-screen-position</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>If you customize <em>scroll-conservatively</em> to a value greater than 100,
Emacs will never recenter point in the window when it scrolls due to
cursor motion commands or commands that move point (e.f., <em>M-g M-g</em>).
Previously, you needed to use <em>most-positive-fixnum</em> as the value of
<em>scroll-conservatively</em> to achieve the same effect.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Aggressive</strong> scrolling now honors the scroll margins.
If you customize <em>scroll-up-aggressively</em> or
<em>scroll-down-aggressively</em> and move point off the window, Emacs now
scrolls the window so as to avoid positioning point inside the scroll
margin.</p></li>
</ul>

<h1>GTK improvements</h1>

<p>Linux users are in for a treat:</p>

<ul>
<li>GTK scroll bars are finally placed on the right by default. 
You can still use <em>set-scroll-bar-mode</em> to change this.</li>
<li>GTK tool bars can have just text, just images or images and text.
Customize <em>tool-bar-style</em> to choose style.  On a Gnome desktop, the default
is taken from the desktop settings.</li>
<li>GTK tool bars can be placed on the left/right or top/bottom of the frame.
The frame-parameter tool-bar-position controls this.  It takes the values
top, left, right or bottom.  The <strong>Options =&gt; Show/Hide</strong> menu has entries
for this.</li>
<li>The colors for selected text (the region face) are taken from the GTK
theme when Emacs is built with GTK.</li>
<li>Emacs uses GTK tooltips by default if built with GTK.  You can turn that
off by customizing x-gtk-use-system-tooltips.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Cocoa (OS X improvements)</h1>

<p>OS X users seem to be a bit neglected, but still:</p>

<ul>
<li>the annoying bug with the cursor not having an inverse video face
(meaning you couldn't see the symbol under it) is finally fixed</li>
<li>the menu bar can be hidden by customizing
ns-auto-hide-menu-bar.</li>
</ul>

<h1>ELPA (a package manager for Emacs)</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>An Emacs Lisp package manager (aka ELPA) is now included.
This is a convenient way to download and install additional packages,
from a package repository at elpa.gnu.org.</p></li>
<li><p>The addition of external repositories is also supported ( I'm
particularly fond of the <a href="http://marmalade-repo.org/">Marmalade repo</a>)</p></li>
<li><p><em>M-x list-packages</em> shows a list of packages, which can be
selected for installation.</p></li>
<li><p>New command <em>describe-package</em>, bound to <em>C-h P</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>By default, all installed packages are loaded and activated
automatically when Emacs starts up.  To disable this, set
<em>package-enable-at-startup</em> to nil.  To change which packages are
loaded, customize <em>package-load-list</em>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I'm personally a little bit underwhelmed by ELPA at this point. It
lacks something that I deem rather critical - the ability to upgrade
already installed packages automatically. Hopefully, this deficiency
will be amended in the near future.</p>

<p>There is also the restrictive licensing policy that GNU enforces
that will certainly prevent a lot of packages from being distributed
via the official ELPA repo.</p>

<h1>Custom color themes</h1>

<p>Most hackers are very fond of custom color themes. I'm no exception -
after all I'm the maintainer of the <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/zenburn-emacs">Zenburn color theme for Emacs</a>. The
problems with custom color themes so far was that depended on the
horrible external package color-theme, that wasn't maintained
particularly actively in the past few years.</p>

<p>Now Emacs 24 comes with a built-in theming infrastructure
affectionately called <strong>deftheme</strong> and several quite nice themes that
Emacs users can choose from (like tango). I've already ported Zenburn to the
deftheme infrastructure, so if you like it be sure to give it a
try. The magic command you'll need to keep in mind is called <em>load-theme</em>.</p>

<h2>Editing improvements</h2>

<p>Emacs is after all mostly an editor and there is a lot of work done in
the editing area in 24:</p>

<h1>Search changes</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>C-y in Isearch is now bound to isearch-yank-kill, instead of
isearch-yank-line.</p></li>
<li><p>M-y in Isearch is now bound to isearch-yank-pop, instead of
isearch-yank-kill.</p></li>
<li><p>M-s C-e in Isearch is now bound to isearch-yank-line.</p></li>
</ul>

<h1>General</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>There is a new command <em>count-words-region</em>, which does what you expect.</p></li>
<li><p><em>completion-at-point</em> now handles tags and semantic completion.</p></li>
<li><p>The default value of <em>backup-by-copying-when-mismatch</em> is now t.</p></li>
<li><p>The command <em>just-one-space</em> (C-SPC), if given a negative argument,
also deletes newlines around point.</p></li>
</ul>

<h1>Deletion changes</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>New option <em>delete-active-region</em>.
If non-nil, C-d, [delete], and DEL delete the region if it is active
and no prefix argument is given.  If set to <em>kill</em>, these commands
kill instead.</p></li>
<li><p>New command <em>delete-forward-char</em>, bound to C-d and [delete].
This is meant for interactive use, and obeys <em>delete-active-region</em>.
The command <em>delete-char</em> does not obey <em>delete-active-region</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><em>delete-backward-char</em> is now a Lisp function.
Apart from obeying <em>delete-active-region</em>, its behavior is unchanged.
However, the byte compiler now warns if it is called from Lisp; you
should use delete-char with a negative argument instead.</p></li>
<li><p>The option <em>mouse-region-delete-keys</em> has been deleted.</p></li>
</ul>

<h1>Selection changes</h1>

<p>The default handling of clipboard and primary selections was changed
to conform with modern X applications.  In short, most commands for
killing and yanking text now use the clipboard, while mouse commands
use the primary selection.</p>

<p>In the following, we provide a list of these changes, followed by a
list of steps to get the old behavior back if you prefer that.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>select-active-regions</em> now defaults to t.
Merely selecting text (e.g. with drag-mouse-1) no longer puts it in
the kill ring.  The selected text is put in the primary selection, if
the system possesses a separate primary selection facility (e.g. X).</p></li>
<li><p><em>select-active-regions</em> also accepts a new value, <em>only</em>.
This means to only set the primary selection for temporarily active
regions (usually made by mouse-dragging or shift-selection);
&quot;ordinary&quot; active regions, such as those made with C-SPC followed by
point motion, do not alter the primary selection.</p></li>
<li><p><em>mouse-drag-copy-region</em> now defaults to nil.</p></li>
<li><p>mouse-2 is now bound to <em>mouse-yank-primary</em>.
This pastes from the primary selection, ignoring the kill-ring.
Previously, mouse-2 was bound to <em>mouse-yank-at-click</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><em>x-select-enable-clipboard</em> now defaults to t on all platforms.</p></li>
<li><p><em>x-select-enable-primary</em> now defaults to nil.
Thus, commands that kill text or copy it to the kill-ring (such as
M-w, C-w, and C-k) also use the clipboard---not the primary selection.</p></li>
<li><p>The &quot;Copy&quot;, &quot;Cut&quot;, and &quot;Paste&quot; items in the &quot;Edit&quot; menu are now
exactly equivalent to, respectively M-w, C-w, and C-y.</p></li>
<li><p>Note that on MS-Windows, <em>x-select-enable-clipboard</em> was already
non-nil by default, as Windows does not support the primary selection
between applications.</p></li>
<li><p>Support for X cut buffers has been removed.</p></li>
<li><p>Support for X clipboard managers has been added.</p></li>
<li><p>To inhibit use of the clipboard manager, set
<em>x-select-enable-clipboard-manager</em> to nil.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>New modes</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Occur Edit mode applies edits made in *Occur* buffers to the
original buffers.  It is bound to C-x C-q in Occur mode. This
basically removes the need for an external package such as iedit.el.</p></li>
<li><p>New global minor modes electric-pair-mode, electric-indent-mode,
and electric-layout-mode. One of my favourite new
additions. electric-pair-mode renders obsolete the popular
autopair-mode and electric-indent-mode and electric-layout-mode
provide a much more IDE feel to the editing experience in Emacs. This
triumvirate of modes has been a long time coming</p></li>
<li><p>secrets.el is an implementation of the Secret Service API, an
interface to password managers like GNOME Keyring or KDE Wallet.  The
Secret Service API requires D-Bus for communication.  The command
<em>secrets-show-secrets</em> offers a buffer with a visualization of the
secrets.</p></li>
<li><p>notifications.el provides an implementation of the Desktop
Notifications API.  It requires D-Bus for communication.</p></li>
<li><p>soap-client.el supports access to SOAP web services from Emacs.
soap-inspect.el is an interactive inspector for SOAP WSDL structures.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Epilogue</h2>

<p>Emacs 24 brings quite a lot to the table. I've barely scratch the
surface as far as the new features are concerned. There is so much
more - improvements to lots of the existing modes (most notably much
better support for distributed VC systems such as Git, Mercurial and
Bazaar), internal cleanups and improvements, etc.</p>

<p>I truly feel that Emacs 24 will be the most important Emacs release in
a long long time and I commend the new dev team leads for their
passion and resolve to modernize Emacs.</p>

<p>Expect future blog posts dedicated to specific new features and
improvements.</p>

<p>P.S. Btw <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/emacs-prelude">The Emacs Prelude</a>
already makes use of some the new features from Emacs 24. In due time
it will make use of much more of them. It's one of the very few
advanced Emacs setups targeting exclusively Emacs 24.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>A lot of people have been asking me about the level of stability and
usability of Emacs 24 at this point since I didn't mention them at my
article. I've been using Emacs 24 for all of my work for about a month
now and I've experienced absolutely no crashes/freezes/any sort of
instabilities. On the usability side I've encountered a few bugs that
might be related to some work in progress (for instance face inheritance doesn't
work with deftheme), but nothing major.</p>

<p>If you're considering trying out Emacs 24 more seriously - my advice
is to go for it. With no clear release date in sight you might be in
for a long wait before the final release is here and you'll be missing
on some really great features in the meantime. I'll write a separate
article soon detailing how to get started with Emacs 24 on the most
popular platforms (Linux, OS X and Windows).</p>

<h2><a href="/Linux/Debian/2011/07/04/debian-tips.html">Debian post installation setup &amp; tips</a></h2>

<h1>Overture</h1>

<p>I've recently been using Debian a lot (mostly Debian Wheezy (aka
testing)), So I've decided to adapt my
<a href="/Linux/Fedora/2011/05/31/fedora-15-tips.html">Fedora 15 post installation setup &amp; tips</a>
article for Debian. Here are some of the common things I add to a
typical &quot;graphical desktop&quot; Debian installation as well as some tips
and tricks that you'll hopefully find useful. Btw, I highly recommend
you to use the <a href="http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/daily-builds/daily/arch-latest/amd64/iso-cd/debian-testing-amd64-netinst.iso">netinstall Debian distribution</a> - that way you'll get an
up-to-date installation immediately and you won't have to download
huge installation images.</p>

<p>This article will be of use mostly to people using Debian as a desktop
OS (with GNOME as their desktop environment) - it doesn't discuss any server configurations.</p>

<h1>Tweak defaults</h1>

<p><strong>Configure sudo</strong></p>

<p>sudo gives you a way to execute single commands as the superuser. You
can also do this with &quot;su -c&quot;, but you have to quote the commands there,
which I don't like very much. To enable sudo for some account first
run the command:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="gp">$</span> su -c <span class="s2">&quot;visudo&quot;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The file /etc/sudoers will open up in a customized vi editor. Append
somewhere to the end of the file the following line:</p>

<p><code>username ALL=(ALL) ALL</code></p>

<p>You should replace <em>username</em> with your username.</p>

<h1>apt-get + apt-cache or aptitude</h1>

<p>There are two common ways (and many others less popular or obsolete)
to manage packages on a Debian system these days - the simpler apt-get
+ apt-cache combo or the more advanced aptitude tool. I tend to prefer
using aptitude since it's a all-in-one solution - you could use it to both
query and install packages and has both a CLI and a curses interface.</p>

<p>It doesn't really matter whether you decided to use apt-get/apt-cache
or aptitude, but you shouldn't mix their usage - pick one and stay
with it.</p>

<h1>Install additional software</h1>

<p>I generally install Debian from the netinstall images and don't
customize very much the default package set since it's so easy to
install everything you need afterwards.</p>

<p><strong>Install REAL text editors</strong></p>

<p>gedit is ok for causal text editing, but professionals like software
engineers and system administrators will definitely need something more:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="gp">$</span> sudo aptitude install emacs vim
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Personally I use Emacs most of the time and use vim only to edit
config files that require root access. If you need an advanced Emacs
setup my suggestion is the <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/emacs-dev-kit">Emacs Dev Kit</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Install Z Shell</strong></p>

<p>It's no secret that I love the Z Shell - after all I
<a href="/Z%20Shell/2011/04/29/one-shell-to-rule-them-all.html">rave about it</a>
quite often. It should come as no surprise that I happen to use it and
probably you should start using it as well:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="gp">$</span> sudo aptitude install zsh
<span class="gp">$</span> sudo vim /etc/passwd
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Find the line about your account and change there <strong>/bin/bash</strong> to
<strong>/usr/bin/zsh</strong>. Alternatively you can use the chsh program to
achieve the same result:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="go"> </span>
<span class="gp">$</span> sudo chsh
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Afterwards start a new login shell and a simple wizard will
fire up asking you some questions to create a default .zshrc file for
you. Alternatively you can use the excellent <a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh">O My Zsh</a> config - I'm
very fond of it.</p>

<p><strong>Install guake(a drop down terminal)</strong></p>

<p>I spend a lot of time at the terminal and like to have one at my
fingertips always. Since I'm a GNOME user guake is the best option for
me:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="gp">$</span> sudo aptitude install guake
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><strong>Install LibreOffice</strong></p>

<p>LibreOffice is currently the best Linux option for word processing,
spreadsheet handling and presentation creation. It's generally
installed by default if you select the &quot;Graphical Desktop&quot; option in
the installation wizard, but you can install the
most common components at any time with the following command:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="gp">$</span> sudo aptitude install libreoffice-calc libreoffice-impress libreoffice-draw libreoffice-writer
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>LibreOffice uses hunspell to do spellchecking. An English dictionary
will be installed by default, but you'll need to install additional
dictionaries manually:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="gp">$</span> sudo aptitude install hunspell-bg
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This command will install the Bulgarian hunspell dictionary. You
likely don't need it so install some more helpful dictionary instead. :-)</p>

<p><strong>Install OpenJDK</strong></p>

<p>If you need to run Java programs/applets:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="gp">$</span> sudo aptitude install openjdk-6-jre
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If you're planning to do some Java development:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="gp">$</span> sudo aptitude install openjdk-6-jdk openjdk-6-doc openjdk-6-demo openjdk-6-source
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><strong>Install Deluge torrent client</strong></p>

<p>The default Transmission torrent client is pretty basic. I recommend
you to replace it with the much more feature-rich deluge:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="gp">$</span> sudo aptitude install deluge
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><strong>Install Inconsolata font</strong></p>

<p>I'm a software engineer and I obviously spend a lot of time reading
and writing source code. I'm very picking about the monospace font
that I use and currently Inconsolata happens to be my favorite:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="gp">$</span> sudo aptitude install ttf-inconsolata
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><strong>Install GIMP</strong>
A lot of you might need an image editor. GIMP is generally
considered the best option so you might want to install it:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="gp">$</span> sudo aptitude install gimp
</code></pre>
</div>

<h1>Install additional patent encumbered/proprietary software</h1>

<p><strong>Enable non-free repo</strong></p>

<p>Just add contrib and non-free to the list of your enabled repos. Your
first line in /etc/apt/sources.list should look like this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="go">deb http://ftp.bg.debian.org/debian/ wheezy main contrib non-free</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Then do a:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="gp">$</span> sudo aptitude update
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><strong>Install proprietary codecs</strong></p>

<p>No MP3 support in Debian by default? And almost no video codecs?
Non-free to the rescue! Type this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="gp">$</span> sudo aptitude install gstreamer-plugins-ugly gstreamer-plugins-bad gstreamer-ffmpeg
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><strong>Install VLC</strong></p>

<p>With MPlayer's development in stagnation VLC has established itself as
the best video player for Linux recently. Installing it is as easy as typing the following command:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="gp">$</span> sudo aptitude install vlc
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><strong>Install Adobe Flash Player</strong></p>

<p>Love it or hate it - you probably need it.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="gp">$</span> sudo aptitude install flashplugin-nonfree
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You can omit this if you're planning to use Google Chrome (on a 32bit system), since it
comes with Flash Player built-in.</p>

<p><strong>Install Skype</strong></p>

<p>In a perfect world everyone would be using Google Talk... In the real one:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="gp">$</span> sudo aptitude install skype
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><strong>Install Oracle JDK</strong></p>

<p>OpenJDK is great, but due to licensing problems it's not quite the
same as the Oracle JDK. If you start experiencing strange problems
(mostly in Swing programs) you'd probably do well to try the Oracle
JDK instead. The magic incantation goes like this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="gp">$</span> sudo aptitude install sun-java6-jdk sun-java6-demo sun-java6-source sun-java6-plugin
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Debian uses OpenJDK by default, so you'll have to do some more work to
tell it to start using Oracle JDK. The <strong>alternatives</strong> program allows
you to select between multiple installed versions of a program:</p>

<p>These commands will make alternative aware of the java binaries and
set high priorities to them which will make them the default Java
binaries. You can use &quot;alternatives --config binaryname&quot; to select
active binaries manually.</p>

<p><strong>Install Google Chrome</strong></p>

<p>Firefox is dying, Google Chrome is the new king of the
browsers. Download it from the <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">official site</a> and install it:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="gp">$</span> sudo dpk -i ~/Downloads/google-chrome-stable_current_i386.deb 
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Google Chrome will install a apt repository as well, so you'll receive
updates as soon as they arrive.</p>

<p>Alternatively you can use Chromium - Chrome's open source sibling:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="gp">$</span> sudo aptitude install chromium-browser
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><strong>Install DropBox</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.dropbox.com">DropBox</a> is a great file sharing service
which allows you to sync files between all of your computers and
mobile devices(Android, iPhone, iPad, etc). It has a great Linux
client which I use all the time. It's available in the non-free repo
so you can install it like this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="gp">$</span> sudo aptitude install nautilus-dropbox
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Hopefully some of my setup has made your setup more enjoyable and more

other things that I consider to be generally helpful.</p>

<h2><a href="/Ruby/Rails/Python/Django/2011/06/19/django-vs-rails.html">Django 1.3 vs Rails 3: A not so final showdown</a></h2>

<h2>Overture</h2>

<p>I've recently started a new job at an American start-up company. My
position in the company is the one of Technical Lead - the person responsible for
the selection of technologies around which the projects are being
built. Since we'll be doing mostly web development we've had a long
kick-off discussion with the company's CTO about the direction which we should
initially take. He had PHP in mind, but I convinced him that Ruby or
Python would make much better platforms for our futures apps. So he
tasked me to research the two leading frameworks in the Ruby and
Python land - namely Ruby on Rails 3 and Django 1.3. I had a week to
prepare some prototypes with both and create on overview for my
boss. I had some experience with Rails 2 a few years back and I have
fairly decent knowledge of Ruby. My Python is not as fluent
(admittedly), but still - I've played a lot with Python
recently. Django, however, was completely new to me. In this article
I'll try to compare the frameworks in a totally friendly way; if
you've expected an epic flame war post you may very well stop reading
here. I'm obviously no Rails/Django guru, so if I've
written something that is wrong - please feel free to correct me.</p>

<p>Please, keep in mind that a short comparison article cannot even begin
to scratch the immense power and complexity of such frameworks. The overview,
that you'll find here is a bit on the superficial side, but it should
give you enough pointers to get you started.</p>

<p>Hopefully this article will be useful to people that are in the same
boat as was - picking between Rails and Django.</p>

<h2>Setup &amp; Getting started</h2>

<h1>Rails</h1>

<p><strong>Linux &amp; OSX</strong></p>

<p>The recommended (by me) way to install Ruby and Ruby on Rails 3.x is via
<a href="https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/">RVM</a>. RVM allows you to have several
version of Ruby installed at the same time and to easily switch
between them. It also allows you to create gem sets, which are quite
handy in testing. After you've installed RVM it's easy to install any
Ruby interpreter and Rails. This example shows how to get RVM, MRI 1.9.2
and Rails current (3.0.9):</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="gp">$</span> bash &lt; &lt;<span class="o">(</span>curl -s https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/install/rvm<span class="o">)</span>
<span class="gp">$</span> <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s1">&#39;[[ -s &quot;$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm&quot; ]] &amp;&amp; . &quot;$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm&quot; # Load RVM function&#39;</span> &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile
<span class="gp">$</span> <span class="nb">source</span> ~/.bash_profile
<span class="gp">$</span> rvm install 1.9.2
<span class="gp">$</span> rvm use 1.9.2 --default
<span class="gp">$</span> which ruby
<span class="go">~/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.2-p180/bin/ruby</span>
<span class="gp">$</span> ruby -v
<span class="go">ruby 1.9.2p180 (2011-02-18 revision 30909) [i686-linux]</span>
<span class="gp">$</span> gem install rails
<span class="gp">$</span> rails -v
<span class="go">Rails 3.0.9</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Since RVM builds Ruby environments from source you might need to
install a few dependencies first. After you've install RVM it will
output those packages as instructions.</p>

<p>If you're using Z Shell (like me) you should replace .bash_profile
with .zshenv or .zshrc.</p>

<p><strong>Windows</strong></p>

<p>While there are many ways to get Ruby on Rails installed on a Windows
host, the simplest is certainly to use the <a href="http://railsinstaller.org/">RailsInstaller</a>. It has only one
little drawback - currently it comes with Ruby 1.8.7 bundled, but the
recent beta already features Ruby 1.9.2. </p>

<p>As you can see the structure of a Rails project consists of quite a
few folders and files. This is a bit intimidating at first, but
becomes quite valuable once you've used to the predefined
structure. You'll find a good overview of the structure <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/book/ruby-on-rails-tutorial#sec:the_first_application">here</a>.</p>

<p>Open your browser and type
<a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a> as the url. If
everything is OK you'll see a Rails welcome page.</p>

<p>At this point you should probably either start playing with
scaffolding or read the rest of this article and start playing with
scaffolding afterwards :-) For instance you can try:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="gp">$</span> rails g scaffold User first_name:string last_name:string email:string password:string
<span class="gp">$</span> rake db:migrate
<span class="gp">$</span> rails s
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Open your browser and type
<a href="http://localhost/users:3000">http://localhost:3000</a> as the
url. &quot;Magic&quot; like this made Rails famous originally.</p>

<p>By default Rails apps use SQLite as a database backend, so might have
to install it as well.</p>

<p>The rails script is useful for various tasks - code generation,
plug-in installation, running a rails console, running a development
web server, etc.</p>

<h1>Django</h1>

<p><strong>Linux</strong></p>

<p>I prefer to install django from the distribution's package manager. On
a Red Hat distro like Fedora I would do:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="gp">$</span> sudo yum install Django
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>And on a Debian system:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="gp">$</span> sudo apt-get install python-django
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>A popular alternative (that would work for OSX and Windows users as
well) to this distro-specific approach is to use a
python package manager like <a href="http://packages.python.org/distribute/easy_install.html">easy_install</a> or <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip">pip</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Windows</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://bitnami.org/stack/djangostack">Bitnami Django stack</a> is the simplest way to get Django and
everything that it requires in a single step.</p>

<p><strong>Your first app</strong></p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="gp">$</span> django-admin startproject djangodemo
<span class="gp">$</span> ll djangodemo 
<span class="go">total 16</span>
<span class="go">-rw-r--r-- 1 bozhidar bozhidar    0 Jun 19 09:45 __init__.py</span>
<span class="go">-rwxr-xr-x 1 bozhidar bozhidar  503 Jun 19 09:45 manage.py*</span>
<span class="go">-rw-r--r-- 1 bozhidar bozhidar 5039 Jun 19 09:45 settings.py</span>
<span class="go">-rw-r--r-- 1 bozhidar bozhidar  577 Jun 19 09:45 urls.py</span>
<span class="gp">$</span> <span class="nb">cd </span>djangodemo
<span class="gp">$</span> ./manage.py runserver
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Compared to Rails, Django created a much simpler project
structure. There are only four files in here and only two are actual
Django configuration files - settings.py and urls.py. manage.py is
just a script useful for managing some aspects of the project (similar
to the rails script) - it can sync the model with the database, run a
development web server, run a django console, etc.</p>

<p>To test the new project open
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/"><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/">http://127.0.0.1:8000/</a></a> in your browser.</p>

<h2>Features at a glance</h2>

<h1>Rails</h1>

<p><strong>Convention over configuration</strong></p>

<p>The centerpiece of Rails's philosophy is called convention over
configuration(CoC). This basically means that a Rails project has a
predefined layout and sensible defaults. All components (models,
views, controllers, layouts, css, javascript, etc) have standard
places where you should drop them and the application picks them up without
any additional effort on your part. </p>

<p>People seem to underestimate the importance of CoC in practice
initially - it
makes it a lot easier to reason about a project and a lot easier to
configure the project. On the other hand if some of the defaults don't
work for you - you'd have to jump through some hoops. Recent versions
of Rails, however, have made it a lot easier to tweak the defaults.</p>

<p>All in all I feel that CoC is a big win for developers and I guess
many people share my opinion since CoC can now be found in many other
frameworks as well.</p>

<p><strong>MVC to the bone</strong></p>

<p>Rails is a classical Model-View-Controller full stack web framework -
it handle all aspects of a typical web application. What separates it
from most of the MVC frameworks around is the heavy emphasis on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer">REST</a>. The
domain objects are treated as resources and could be handled in a
uniform manner using just the standard HTTP verbs like GET, PUT,
DELETE, POST. REST is extremely good fit for data driven applications.</p>

<p>As usual the model houses the application's business logic, the
controller invokes functionality from the model layer and feeds the
resulting data to the view layer, which display the data in a
meaningful way to the user.</p>

<p>The model layer is the home of your domain objects and the business
logic surrounding them. Domain objects (a.k.a. entities) are mapped to
database tables (at least in RDBMS). Unlike most object relational
mappers Rails's ActiveRecord (the default ORM; could be substituted
with something else if you wish) doesn't require you to explicitly
declare the structure of the objects, but rather extracts it
automatically from your DB table definitions. A simple class, modeling
an application user might look like this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">User</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ActiveRecord</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Base</span>
  <span class="n">validates</span> <span class="ss">:first_name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:last_name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:email</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:password</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:presence</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kp">true</span>
  <span class="n">validates</span> <span class="ss">:password</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">confirmation</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kp">true</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Note that the validation methods are entirely optional (but highly
recommended) - the class could have very well had an empty body. Rails
would know to look for a table named Users in the database and extract
the field information from it.</p>

<p>Rails generates automatically for us &quot;finders&quot; that we can use to make
queries about objects in pure Ruby. It also provides an elegant DSL to
express relationships between various model classes (belongs_to,
has_many, etc)</p>

<p>In the view layer Rails has traditionally relied on HTML templates
with Ruby code embedded in them (html.erb). There are a lot of
community contributed alternatives, however, with HAML being the most
prominent one. On a similar note Rails allows you to use SASS as a
replacement for traditional CSS.</p>

<p>Another centerpiece in Rails is the &quot;Don't Repeat Yourself&quot;(DRY)
principle. In the view layer partial templates, layouts and helpers
are some of the tools available to help you abide by that
principle. You'll certainly make heavy use of them in your
applications so you should pay them some special attention.</p>

<p><strong>Database migrations</strong></p>

<p>Everyone that has done some serious programming knows that it's not
realistic to presume that the initial database schema won't ever
change - fields get added/removed, new tables get introduced,
etc. All those changes are commonly referred to as &quot;migrations&quot; and
traditionally every team unrolls its own handling of the problem. On
my last job I was tasked at some point to write a tool in Java that
analyzed a config file and a directory structure filled with SQL
scripts and applied them selectively to various target databases. In
Rails you get this functionally for free - you can express your
migrations as simple Ruby scripts and you can use rake to generate the
appropriate SQL statements for any supported database. Here's a simple
migration script, that creates the Users table:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">CreateUsers</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ActiveRecord</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Migration</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nc">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nf">up</span>
    <span class="n">create_table</span> <span class="ss">:users</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">|</span>
      <span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">string</span> <span class="ss">:first_name</span>
      <span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">string</span> <span class="ss">:last_name</span>
      <span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">string</span> <span class="ss">:email</span>
      <span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">string</span> <span class="ss">:password</span>

      <span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">timestamps</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nc">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nf">down</span>
    <span class="n">drop_table</span> <span class="ss">:users</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The up method gets invoked when the migration is applied and the down
method gets invoked when it's reverted. Rails 3.1 will offer even more
elegant migrations. To execute all migrations:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="gp">$</span> rake db:migrate
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><strong>Ajax from within</strong></p>

<p>Rails features tight integration with JavaScript and AJAX. Versions
prior to 3.1 shipped by default the prototype and scriptaculous
JavaScript libraries. In
version 3.1 jQuery will replace them as the default JavaScript
library.</p>

<p>Making and handling AJAX requests in Rails is generally very easy - a
big advantage in today world ruled by rich and dynamic web UIs.</p>

<p><strong>Extensibility</strong></p>

<p>Rails is extendable through a multitude of community supplied plugins
that could add incredible functionality to your apps for free. Some of
my favorite plugins are <a href="https://github.com/indirect/jquery-rails">jQuery for Rails</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/bcardarella/client_side_validations">client side validations</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sferik/rails_admin">Rails Admin</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Testing is not optional</strong></p>

<p>What I particularly like about Rails is that it heavily promotes
testing your code. All of the Rails generators would generate test
stubs, that you'll do good to fill in. Rails supports all major Ruby test
frameworks - Test::Unit, RSpec, Cucumber. You have fixtures support, test
database support, the ability to run unit and functional test
separately. I don't recall using any other framework that pays as much
attention to having tests as Rails and for that I can only
congratulate the Rails team.</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility with Ruby versions</strong></p>

<p>There are two major version of Ruby out there presently - Ruby 1.8.7
and Ruby 1.9.2. Ruby 1.9.2 offers substantial language and performance
improvements, so you should be pleased to hear that Rails supports
both major Ruby versions. Rails 4.0 will drop support for Ruby 1.8.x.</p>

<p>Rails can also be run on top of JRuby and Rubinius.</p>

<p><strong>Deployment options</strong></p>

<p>The most common deployment options for Rails are currently Apache
HTTPD or NginX and Phusion Passenger (mod_rails). People shopping for
cloud Rails deployment should definitely take a look at Heroku.</p>

<p>Rails also runs on alternative Ruby implementations like JRuby and
Rubinius (as mentioned above), that offer exciting new possibilities. For instance using
JRuby allows you to deploy a Rails app into a Java application server
like JBoss or Glassfish and to tap into all those great Java libraries
and frameworks around. Using JRuby also gives you the opportunity to
deploy your apps on Google's App Engine.</p>

<h1>Django</h1>

<p><strong>A simpler project layout</strong></p>

<p>While I had some experience with Rails from a couple of years ago,
Django was something totally new to me. I expected it to be more or
less Rails for Python, but when I created my first Django app I was
surprised to see that the project folder consisted of only three
files (I'm obviously not counting the python package file
<strong>init</strong>.py).</p>

<p>My initial surprise aside it turned out that most differences were
just superficial and that Django and Rails have quite a lot of
similarities. I'll, however, speak a bit more about the different
stuff than the similar stuff.</p>

<p><strong>MVC(MTV), Django style</strong></p>

<p>While Django is a MVC controller framework as well, it's built around a
different mindset. Django is totally configurable and minimalistic
framework that empowers the developers to tailor it to their needs. </p>

<p>A Django project is comprised of autonomous and reusable apps. Apps on
the other hand are comprised of models, views and templates. Django
differs a bit in terminology with Rails - the Rails controllers are
views in Django and the Rails views are called templates in Django. You
can sometimes hear that Django is a Model-Template-View framework -
that shouldn't confuse you. Although the terminology is different the
principles are the same.</p>

<p>Django's default ORM is somewhat reminiscent of frameworks like
Hibernate. Entity classes declare explicitly the all the
attributes. Let's consider again the User model class:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="python"><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">django.db</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">models</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">User</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Model</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">first_name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">CharField</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">max_length</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">30</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">last_name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">CharField</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">max_length</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">30</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">email</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">EmailField</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="n">password</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">CharField</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">max_length</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">30</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Both approaches have their strengths and weaknesses an usual. In
Django's case we have increased verbosity, but on the other had we
don't have to inquire the database to figure out the exact definition
of model records.</p>

<p>Like in Rails we get useful &quot;finders&quot; that can be used to query for model
objects in pure python (as opposed to using sql).</p>

<p><strong>In the template layer</strong></p>

<p>While ERB is basically HTML with Ruby embedded in it, Django features
a custom templating language with it's own (extendable) tag
library. This generally means that Django templates tend to be a bit
cleaner than Rails's templates, since you're not allowed to abuse them
very much. On the other hand you can do virtually anything by
embedding code directly in a template, so as usual - each design
decision has its pros and cons. </p>

<p>Django supports alternative templating libraries, so you're covered in
case you don't like the default one.</p>

<p>Django also features a powerful form generation/handling facilities
that integrate seamlessly with the templating layer. For instance - it
very easy to generate a form matching the structure of a domain model
object with automatic property validation.</p>

<p><strong>You're in charge</strong></p>

<p>Django has doesn't adhere to the Rails CoC philosophy. It's assumed
that developers know best what layout and configurations options make
the most sense in their applications. I haven't played that much with
Django yet, but I still haven't come by two different Django apps that
are structured in the same manner. While I understand the benefits of
Django's approach I still prefer Rails's approach. I've worked long
enough to know that you're rarely in the position to make better
decisions about the structure and the defaults of your app, than the
exceptional developers with huge experience that develop frameworks
like Rails and Django.</p>

<p>To illustrate this consider the strong emphasis Rails places on
REST. In Django you could certainly use restful access your resources
as well, but it's all up to you. The framework makes no
suggestions. You can unroll any URL mapping scheme by simply
associating regular expressions in urls.py with callback view
functions:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="python"><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">django.conf.urls.defaults</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">patterns</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">include</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">url</span>

<span class="n">urlpatterns</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">patterns</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">url</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">r&#39;^$&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;djangodemo.views.home&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&#39;home&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">url</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">r&#39;^users&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;djangodemo.view.users&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&#39;list_users&#39;</span><span class="p">))</span>
    
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>An url is mapped to the callback function, which in turn either renders a
template or directly returns some Http response.</p>

<p><strong>Free admin</strong> </p>

<p>Django has a built-in support to generate an admin UI for your
website. This is a very useful feature indeed and is supported in
Rails as well through plugins (I've mentioned the one I like the
best).</p>

<p><strong>Database migrations</strong></p>

<p>One of the few gripes I have with stock Django is that it doesn't
offer an alternative to Rails's migrations. Luckily there is
<a href="http://south.aeracode.org/">South</a> - an extension that provides a
simple, stable and database-independent migration layer to prevent all
the hassle schema changes over time bring to your Django
applications. I highly recommend it to everyone planning to use
Django.</p>

<p><strong>JavaScript and AJAX</strong></p>

<p>Unlike Rails, Django doesn't bundle any JavaScript libraries. You have
to pick a JavaScript framework yourself (which a trivial process). The
AJAX support in Django is both basic and extremely powerful in the
same time - request.is_ajax(). What this means is that you can check
if a request was regular or an AJAX request and respond
accordingly. You don't need much more than that. More details can be
found <a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/AJAX">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>The great divide</strong></p>

<p>Some of you probably know that Python is currently at a bit of a
crossroads. Python 2.x was the stable Python version for many years,
but recently it was replaced by Python 3.x. Python 3.x is all around
great in my personal opinion, but unfortunately it's backward
incompatible with the older 2.x series. For that reason very few high
profile projects still don't support it - Django is one such
project. The current version 1.3 require at least Python 2.4 and will
run with every Python up to 2.7. This is a bit of a disappointment
since you'll be missing on a few very cool new features. On a more
positive note Python 2.7 did backport some goodies from Python 3, so
not all is lost. I've read (at totally unofficial places) that Django 2.0 will be targeting Python 3
and I expect it will be available in about a year.</p>

<p><strong>Deployment</strong></p>

<p>Python is quite mature technology and offers you a nice array of
deployment options - Apache, Nginx and my favorite - Google App
Engine. Python, being one of the two supported languages on the App
Engine (the other one is, of course, Java) makes it very easy to deploy
Django apps on the App Engine (though you'll need the Django support
for non-relational databases to be able to use it).</p>

<p>The also the possibility to deploy Django apps on Java or .Net
infrastructure using Jython or IronPython. </p>

<h2>Community</h2>

<p>When you're selecting the technology for a major project you have to
make sure that the technology is in good shape - there is a solid
community around it, there is no lack of support, innovation and
deployment options.</p>

<p>Both
<a href="http://www.google.com/trends?q=ruby+on+rails%2C+django+python">Google trends</a>
and stackoverflow.com (by the number of question about tagged with
django or rails) indicate that Rails currently has larger
community than Django.</p>

<p>I haven't had any direct communication with the Django community yet,
but I've found a lot of excellent resources about Django on-line. </p>

<p>Rails has one of the most vibrant, passionate and innovative
communities. I've had contact with a lot of people from the Rails
community and I'm certain that it has played a tremendous role in
Rails's growth.  </p>

<h2>Tooling</h2>

<p>Traditionally Ruby &amp; Python hackers have been working with just a
powerful programmer's editor like Emacs, vim or TextMate. While there
is nothing inherently wrong with this approach (I'm an avid Emacs user
myself), I do find IDEs quite helpful when working on larger code
bases, with their trademark features such as intelligent
autocompletion (aka intellisense), safe refactorings, on-the-fly syntax checking, etc. So
here's what we've got:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/">RubyMine</a> - hands down the best Ruby and Rails IDE I've ever
used. The <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/features/index.html">list of features</a> is epic as is the quality of the
project. It support Rails 3, git, RSpec, Cucumber, sass, haml and
many other cool Ruby/Rails related technologies. Sure, it's a
commercial project, but is priced very reasonably. </li>
<li><a href="http://www.aptana.com/">Aptana Studio</a> - a Web development IDE,
built on top of the Eclipse platform. Among many other features it
supports Ruby on Rails.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.activestate.com/komodo-ide">Komodo</a> - an IDE focusing on
dynamic programming language. Great support for both Django and
Rails development. </li>
<li><a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">PyCharm</a> - from the same company that develops RubyMine, PyCharm
is the king of IDEs when it comes down to Python. It has full
featured Django support - there is even autocompletion in the Django
templates.</li>
<li><a href="http://pydev.org/">PyDev</a> - an Eclipse plug-in for Python and Django development.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have to admit I'm totally biased. Having been a long time Java
developer I've grown extremely fond of the exceptional IntelliJ
IDEA. RubyMine and PyCharm are both based on the IntelliJ platform and
bring to the Ruby and Python developers much of the might and magic of
IDEA. There are both commercial products, but their price tags are
quite low and their quality is great - highly recommended.</p>

<p>I'm not affiliated in any way with any of these products - I just
happen to like them that much.</p>

<h2>Resources</h2>

<p>The are LOTS of resources about Rails and Django on-line. Here are
just my favorites.</p>

<h1>Rails</h1>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/">Rails Guides</a> - best short
introduction to Rails ever. Immediately updated for new Rails
versions, fantastic starting point for any aspiring Rails developer.</li>
<li><a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/">Rails Tutorial</a> - best Rails 3 book
on the market and it even has a free on-line edition. Nice follow up
of the Rails Guides.</li>
<li><a href="http://railscasts.com/">RailsCasts</a> - Ryan Bates in true Ruby
hero. He has compiled a unique set of high quality Rails screencasts
that often illustrate some advanced techniques. And they are all
free. We all owe a very big &quot;Thanks!&quot; to Ryan.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Django</h1>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/">Official Docs</a> - best
official project documentation I've read. It's actually so good,
that I never (well - almost never) bothered to look for anything else. All my questions
were answered by the official documentation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Epilogue</h2>

<p>Choosing Django or Rails is basically a win-win situation - you cannot
go wrong. There are too many similarities between the frameworks and
the differences are not something paramount.</p>

<p>Rails places a heavy emphasis on convention over configuration,
provides you with more defaults and does a can do a lot of heavy
lifting for you automagically. </p>

<p>Django on the other hand let's you specify most configuration details
yourself, without making the configuration burdensome (like that of
older Java web frameworks).</p>

<p>Rails has always been leading on the way of innovation - constantly
integration some of the latest and greatest technologies around
(recent examples being jQuery, Coffee Script and SASS). From time to
time backward compatibility is sacrificed for the greater good, so
that is something that you should consider as well.</p>

<p>Django is certainly much more conservative framework as far as
backward compatibility is concerned - after all it still support
Python 2.4.</p>

<p>I guess in the end the choice really boils down to two things - whether you
like Ruby or Python better and whether you like the defaults imposed
to you by Rails.</p>

<p>I've planned to write a much longer and detailed article, but it's
summer here and it's sunday and I'd rather go out and drink a few
beers with my friends. Hopefully you've enjoyed the article. I'll try
to expand it a bit in the coming days.</p>

<p>P.S. Btw, in case you're wondering - we've picked Rails for our
company's projects. It was a very close call, though, since I
really liked a lot of aspects of Django as well.</p>
