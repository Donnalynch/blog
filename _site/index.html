<p>I&#8217;ve been using zsh for about three years now and continue to be impressed the its immense power and flexibility. Switching from bash to zsh was a decision as good as switching from Windows to GNU/Linux, from vim to Emacs, from Eclipse to IntelliJ IDEA. In other words - it was an extremely good decision. :-)</p><p>So I want to finally get the word out, showcase some nice zsh features and probably persuade a couple of bash users to try it. Be warned, however - after you try it there is no going back&#8230;</p><h2 id='getting_started'>Getting started</h2><p>Most distros come with bash by default so you&#8217;ll probably need to install zsh first and configure it as your user&#8217;s shell. On Fedora you&#8217;d do:</p>
<p><p><div class='highlight'><pre><code class='console'><span class='go'>[bozhidar@bozhidar ~]$ sudo yum install zsh</span>
</code></pre>
</div></p></p>
<p>The edit /etc/password and set there zsh as your shell:</p><p>bozhidar:x:500:500:Bozhidar Batsov:/home/bozhidar:/bin/zsh</p><p>The next time you login a terminal wizard with start up asking you about some basic zsh options that you might want to enable. I suggest you to enable them all except the beep option. In the end the wizard will save the new configuration to the file .zshrc in your user&#8217;s home folder.</p><p>Alternatively you may just use a preconfigured .zshrc, like this one:</p><div class='highlight'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='c'># Lines configured by zsh-newuser-install</span>
<span class='nv'>HISTFILE</span><span class='o'>=</span>~/.histfile
<span class='nv'>HISTSIZE</span><span class='o'>=</span>1000
<span class='nv'>SAVEHIST</span><span class='o'>=</span>1000
setopt appendhistory autocd extendedglob nomatch notify correct_all
unsetopt beep
bindkey -e
<span class='c'># End of lines configured by zsh-newuser-install</span>
<span class='c'># The following lines were added by compinstall</span>
zstyle :compinstall filename <span class='s1'>&#39;/home/bozhidar/.zshrc&#39;</span>

autoload -Uz compinit
compinit
<span class='c'># End of lines added by compinstall</span>
</code></pre>
</div><p>I don&#8217;t like very much the default zsh prompt and I generally change it right away. Have a look at my other <a href='/2008/07/27/zsh-prompt.html'>short article</a> on the topic.</p><p>There a couple of configuration files related to zsh that you should know about:</p><ul>
<li>.zshrc - runs for each new shell(roughly equivalent to .bashrc)</li>

<li>.zprofile - runs only for login shells(like .bash_profile)</li>

<li>.zlogout - runs on logout</li>

<li>.zshenv - holds environmental variables</li>
</ul><p>Here&#8217;s an example .zshenv file:</p><div class='highlight'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='nb'>export </span><span class='nv'>JAVA_HOME</span><span class='o'>=</span>/usr/java/latest

<span class='nb'>export </span><span class='nv'>SCALA_HOME</span><span class='o'>=</span>/opt/scala-2.8.1.final

<span class='nb'>export </span><span class='nv'>M2_HOME</span><span class='o'>=</span>/opt/apache-maven-3.0.2

<span class='nb'>export </span><span class='nv'>EDITOR</span><span class='o'>=</span><span class='s2'>&quot;emacsclient -t&quot;</span>
<span class='nb'>export </span><span class='nv'>ALTERNATE_EDITOR</span><span class='o'>=</span><span class='s2'>&quot;&quot;</span>

<span class='c'>#needed to properly display complex color-themes in Emacs and vim</span>
<span class='nb'>export </span><span class='nv'>TERM</span><span class='o'>=</span>xterm-256color

<span class='nb'>typeset</span> -U path
<span class='nv'>path</span><span class='o'>=(</span><span class='nv'>$M2_HOME</span>/bin <span class='nv'>$SCALA_HOME</span>/bin ~/bin ~/Projects/work/bin <span class='nv'>$path</span><span class='o'>)</span>
</code></pre>
</div><p>Please note the way in which the PATH variable is set in zsh, which differs substantially from bash(it&#8217;s just exported there as any other variable).</p><h2 id='playing_around'>Playing around</h2><p>At this point you have the legendary zsh autocompletion configured and you have enabled many of the zsh core features.</p><p><strong>autocd</strong> allows you to navigate to folders only with their name without the cd command. One of my favourite features. Now you can do things like:</p><div class='highlight'><pre><code class='console'><span class='go'>  </span>
<span class='go'>[bozhidar@bozhidar ~]$ Downloads   </span>
<span class='go'>[bozhidar@bozhidar ~/Downloads]$</span>
</code></pre>
</div><p>Instead of:</p>
<p><p><div class='highlight'><pre><code class='console'><span class='go'>[bozhidar@bozhidar ~]$ cd Downloads   </span>
<span class='go'>[bozhidar@bozhidar ~/Downloads]$</span>
</code></pre>
</div></p></p>
<p>By the way autocd was added in bash 4.0 as well. You can enable it there with:</p>
<p><p><div class='highlight'><pre><code class='console'><span class='go'>[bozhidar@bozhidar ~]$ shopt -s autocd</span>
</code></pre>
</div></p></p>
<p><strong>appendhistory</strong> all your open shells share the same history which is handy if you want to refer commands from one shell in another with say Ctrl+R(reverse-history-search)</p><p><strong>extendedglob</strong> allows you to recursive look for files in folders:</p>
<p><p><div class='highlight'><pre><code class='console'><span class='go'>[bozhidar@bozhidar ~]$ ls somedir/**/Makefile</span>
</code></pre>
</div></p></p>
<p>is equivalent to:</p>
<p><p><div class='highlight'><pre><code class='console'><span class='go'>[bozhidar@bozhidar ~]$ find somedir -name Makefile</span>
</code></pre>
</div></p></p>
<p>Most zsh users never use find for simple file look up. This feature was also added to bash 4.0 but it works in a slightly different manner.</p><div class='highlight'><pre><code class='console'><span class='gp'>$</span> <span class='nb'>shopt</span> -s extglob
</code></pre>
</div><p><strong>correct</strong> - autocorrects mistyped commands</p>
<p><p><div class='highlight'><pre><code class='console'><span class='go'>[bozhidar@bozhidar]$ cta ~/.zshrc </span>
<span class='go'>zsh: correct &#39;cta&#39; to &#39;cat&#39; [nyae]?</span>
</code></pre>
</div></p></p>
<h1 id='keybindings'>Keybindings</h1><p>By default zsh uses Emacs keybindings which is perfect for a long time Emacs user like me. zsh doesn&#8217;t use readline, instead it has its own line editing library called zle, which is much more powerful. vi users are not forgotten and can switch zsh to vi keybindings with the command:</p><div class='highlight'><pre><code class='console'><span class='go'>bindkey -v</span>
</code></pre>
</div><p>Mind that by default you&#8217;ll be in &#8220;insert&#8221; mode and have to press ESC to go into command mode.</p><p>You can also create custom keybindings like this:</p><div class='highlight'><pre><code class='console'><span class='go'>bindkey &#39;^[[H&#39; beginning-of-line</span>
<span class='go'>bindkey &#39;^[[F&#39; end-of-line</span>
</code></pre>
</div><p>This will bind the Home and End keys to the commands beginning-of-line and end-of-line.</p><h1 id='aliases'>Aliases</h1><p>Zsh has three different kinds of shell aliases.</p><p><strong>Regular</strong> - same as in bash:</p><div class='highlight'><pre><code class='console'><span class='go'>alias ll=&#39;ls -l&#39;</span>
</code></pre>
</div><p><strong>Suffix</strong> - suffix aliases are supported in zsh since version 4.2.0. Some examples:</p><div class='highlight'><pre><code class='console'><span class='go'>alias -s tex=emacs</span>
<span class='go'>alias -s html=google-chrome</span>
</code></pre>
</div><p>Now when you type in the console</p><div class='highlight'><pre><code class='console'><span class='gp'>$</span> somefile.tex
</code></pre>
</div><p>it will be opened automatically with Emacs. Similarly somefile.html would be opened by google-chrome. As you might imagine this feature is quite handy.</p><p><strong>Global</strong> - global aliases can be used anywhere in the command line(as opposed to regular aliases that can used only in the beginning). Example:</p><div class='highlight'><pre><code class='console'><span class='go'>alias -g ...=&#39;../..&#39;</span>
<span class='go'>cd ...  </span>
</code></pre>
</div><h1 id='some_tips_and_tricks'>Some tips and tricks</h1><ul>
<li>
<p>press Alt+q in the middle of a command you&#8217;re typing. This will clear the console prompt and allow you execute another command(like a man lookup). Afterwards the things you&#8217;ve typed before the Alt+q will magically reappear.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Imagine you&#8217;re in the folder <strong>project/4.0/module</strong>. Typing:</p>
</li>
</ul><div class='highlight'><pre><code class='console'><span class='go'>cd 4.0 5.0 </span>
</code></pre>
</div><p>Will take you to a folder named project/5.0/module(assuming that it exists of course). In general the command has the format <code>cd old new</code>.</p><h1 id='conclusion'>Conclusion</h1><p>There is no easy way to sum up everything that makes zsh great in a single blog post. I&#8217;ll try to expand and improve it in time. I hope I&#8217;ve whetted your appetite to try out zsh. If you like it well enough(of which I&#8217;m most certain you should have a look at the resources in the end as well).</p><h1 id='useful_resources'>Useful resources</h1><ul>

<h2 id='career_development__should_i_stay_or_should_i_go'><a href='/2011/04/29/career-development.html'>Career development - Should I stay or should I go?</a></h2>
<p>I guess nothing describes more appropriately the essence of career development than the famous song by <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1Gn0e7kvTA'>The Clash</a>.</p><p>We generally have two options in front of us when we consider our careers - stay at our current company and hope to advance in it or jump ship to a new hopefully better job in another company. Both have their pros and cons which I&#8217;ll shortly discuss. Mind, though, that I&#8217;m no HR specialist or a pro career adviser so you&#8217;d do well not to rely on my writing a 100%. Also everything I&#8217;ll write comes from my own experience as professional software engineer. I guess some of my advice will not apply to other careers.</p><h1 id='stay_at_my_current_company'>Stay at my current company</h1><p><strong>Disclaimer</strong> - <em>there are some companies that are so great that no one wants to leave them. This section is not about them. This is about the companies we all know and have grown accustomed to tolerate - the ones with the mostly same work, lying bosses and a lot of empty promises.</em></p><p>The idea is basic. You&#8217;ve spent some time in the company, you&#8217;re hoping that in time with hard work and dedication you&#8217;ll rise in the company ranks and you&#8217;ll get a healthy salary increase in the process.</p><p>Unfortunately this doesn&#8217;t happen quite often. Most companies have some internal salary limits and some next to irreplaceable people. This means that there is a cap at your growth there. Sure, if you stay with the company long enough - say 10 years, probably some of the irreplaceable people will be replaced, but is worth the wait?</p><p>When you sit around just doing the same things you tend to get bored and demotivated at times. You become less productive and less interested in your work in general. You just go to work, stay there for 8 hours and go home. The paycheck is the only thing of interest to you and you become duller and duller by the day.</p><p>This is what I call &#8220;flowing down the current&#8221;. One of my former bosses used to say that when you start feeling you&#8217;re flowing down the current you should immediately start looking for another job(that is unless you&#8217;re one of the those people that just like to complain how they hate their job, but actually doesn&#8217;t mind to sit around doing nothing and get paid for it). My boss also used to say that one shouldn&#8217;t spend more than 3 or 4 years in a company he doesn&#8217;t own.</p><p>Of course you shouldn&#8217;t jump between jobs every 6 or so months because this will make you a blacklisted candidate by most HRs - after all they&#8217;re looking most of the time for people ready to commit to their cause for at least a few years.</p><p>Pros of staying:</p><ul>
<li>you know the game and how to play it</li>

<li>you&#8217;re accustomed to colleagues, the office and you don&#8217;t have to change them</li>

<li>you&#8217;ve got a guaranteed paycheck that is unlikely to evaporate</li>

<li>if the company is bigger(100+) you&#8217;ve got a fair chance to advance in the company hierarchy if you&#8217;re willing to stay long enough</li>
</ul><p>Cons of staying:</p><ul>
<li>you limit you&#8217;re professional development</li>

<li>you limit the possibilities for salary improvements</li>
</ul><p>In the end it seems to me that most people are not too fond of taking chances(me included). This is the reason that a lot of average companies have employees that could do a lot better somewhere else. This is partly caused by our very own society - the people and media around us keep telling us that we&#8217;re mostly the same, that it&#8217;s unlikely we&#8217;ll ever achieve something great, something monumental&#8230; and many of us do believe them.</p><p>Hristo Stoichkov might not be the all time greatest philosopher, but said something extremely important once(or twice) - &#8220;If you don&#8217;t play you can&#8217;t win&#8221;(in Bulgarian - &#8220;Който не играе не печели.&#8221;).</p><h1 id='move_to_another_company'>Move to another company</h1><p>Moving to another company is not a silver bullet. Most of the time it guarantees you a higher salary(the top reason why people switch jobs), but it doesn&#8217;t certainly mean you&#8217;ll have a more interesting and fulfilling work. This is especially true if you go to work for some huge corporation and you&#8217;re not part of its Research&amp;Development department. I generally avoid such job offers. Corporations offer some measure of security, but little if any excitement.</p><p>I think that most people should try to find employment in companies that are start-ups or that regularly start to work on new projects. There one has plenty of opportunities to prove himself and to advance in the company along the way. Of course such companies have the nasty habit of going down under from time to time so you have to think long and hard before joining one if you&#8217;re living under rent or have to pay down-payments on two mortgages. Of course if you&#8217;re good enough at your job - you&#8217;ll a new one soon enough and that shouldn&#8217;t really be bothering you.</p><p>Pros of moving: * moving to a new company is likely to represent a raise in your salary you&#8217;ll have to wait several years to get with your current employer * there is a strong possibility that your new work will be more exciting than your old one(after all you&#8217;ve tried to pick a more exciting job, right?) * you might get to meet some interesting new people, learn from them and improve your professional skills</p><p>Cons of moving: * you have to prove your worth again(you&#8217;ve already did this in your old job)</p><ul>
<li>the is the factor of uncertainty every time you start something new</li>

<li>you&#8217;ll have to learn how to work and deal with your new colleagues</li>

<li>you might get more of the same work that made you leave in the first place in case you have chosen carefully your new employer.</li>
</ul><h1 id='conclusion'>Conclusion</h1><p>Topics such a career development are highly subjective and depend on a myriad of factors. My musing here are inspired by my 7 year long career as a software engineer that spanned over four employers and will probably soon include a fifth. This is not a lot of data to consider, but I can assure you that the traits that I describe are most real and are here to stay.</p><div style='font-style: italic; color: #7f9f7f;'>Posted on 29 Apr 2011 by Bozhidar.</div>

<h2 id='programming_languages_worth_learning'><a href='/2011/04/27/programming-languages-worth-learning.html'>Programming languages worth learning</a></h2>
<p>Programming languages have always been a passion of mine and through the years I&#8217;ve learnt quite a few of them. The first one was Pascal some 13 years ago and the last was Scala just a couple of months ago.</p><p>Although the authors of many languages claim that the language they created is the greatest thing after hot water, this is rarely the case. Most of the &#8220;unique&#8221; features are not quite unique and the truly unique stuff is often just useless. I don&#8217;t believe that there is a single greatest and unparallelled language, but I do believe that some languages are more valuable them others in term of both theory(the concepts around which they revolve) and practice(the chances of you landing a job with them or simply getting a task done).</p><p>In this blog post I&#8217;ve review the ten or so languages that I found to be most enlightening/helpful to me over the years. I think that every professional software engineer should have at least a passing knowledge of them.</p><h1 id='c'>C</h1><hr /><p>The C programming language has been around for more than forty years now. While it&#8217;s often viewed as a higher level assembly language today in the era of Java, .Net and Python C remains the sole choice for doing serious system programming - writing drivers, all kinds of servers and virtual machines.</p><p>The best way to get started with C hasn&#8217;t changed in the past 20+ years - just pick a copy of <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-2nd-Brian-Kernighan/dp/0131103628'>&#8220;The C Programming Language&#8221;</a> by K&amp;R.</p><h1 id='lisp'>Lisp</h1><hr /><p><em>&#8220;Lisp is worth learning for the profound enlightenment experience you will have when you finally get it; that experience will make you a better programmer for the rest of your days, even if you never actually use Lisp itself a lot.&#8221;</em> - Eric Raymond</p><p>One of the oldest programming languages around - created in 1958 and still relevant today. Important for its unique code is data approach, advanced code generation facilities(macros) and the ability to develop software in incremental and interactive fashion. Although many of the features that originally made it truly unique(like garbage collection, if expression, function objects) are found in many modern languages Lisp still offers some compelling alternatives for those interested to explore it.</p><p>You cannot start with a better introduction to Lisp that Peter Seibel&#8217;s <a href='http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/'>&#8220;Practical Common Lisp&#8221;</a>.</p><h1 id='java'>Java</h1><hr /><p>Let&#8217;s face it - if you&#8217;re in the market for jobs a third of them are about Java EE or Android development. The language is not quite elegant, but the platform is truly magnificent. Although there are many other languages targeting the JVM(Scala, Groovy, Clojure, JRuby, Jython - just to name a few) Java is still predominant by a wide margin and this is unlikely to change soon.</p><p>I&#8217;ve taught a couple of introductory Java programming courses(in Bulgarian), but I&#8217;d recommend the <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Core-Java-TM-I--Fundamentals-8th/dp/0132354764/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1303901341&amp;sr=1-1'>&#8220;Core Java&#8221;</a> book over my lectures any day of the week. :-)</p><h1 id='haskell'>Haskell</h1><hr /><p>Functional programming has been gaining popularity in recent years with the rise of parallel computers and of the pure functional programming languages Haskell is probably the closest to the mainstream. It features great ideas like type inference, lazy evaluation, monads, pattern matching. As with Lisp many of the features of Haskell can be found in more impure packages(like Scala and Clojure), but Haskell is still the top pure functional language in my humble opinion. It also has really great free learning resources on-line like <a href='http://learnyouahaskell.com/'>&#8220;Learn you a Haskell for great good&#8221;</a> and <a href='http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/'>&#8220;Real world Haskell&#8221;</a></p><h1 id='perl'>Perl</h1><hr /><p>Once the undisputed king of the Internet Perl has recently fallen down from grace in its battle with the newer generation of dynamic languages like PHP, Ruby and Python. While I wouldn&#8217;t advise anyone to start writing Web apps with Perl it&#8217;s still the best language for writing administration and helper scripts with minimum fuss and maximum developer throughput. It also has the greatest support for text processing ever and an extremely flexible(albeit a bit of confusing) syntax.</p><p>Pick up a copy of <a href='http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596520113'>&#8220;Learning Perl&#8221;</a> or just browse the excellent <em>perldoc</em> and start coding in Perl right away.</p><h1 id='clojure'>Clojure</h1><hr /><p>Clojure is a Lisp dialect with an unique support for parallel and concurrent programming and runs on top of the venerable JVM. If you&#8217;re looking to do some serious parallel programming look no further.</p><p>To get started I recommend you to watch the free Clojure screencasts on <a href='http://clojure.blip.tv/'>blip.tv</a>.</p><h1 id='prolog'>Prolog</h1><hr /><p>The most famous language from the logic programming family. Solving a problem like a sudoku puzzle in Prolog will be an eye opening experience for any developer. While it&#8217;s unlikely that you&#8217;ll ever use it practice the ideas found in Prolog will truly expand your thinking horizons.</p><h1 id='ruby'>Ruby</h1><hr /><p>A pure object oriented dynamic scripting language with a very nice support for metaprogramming. Has versions written in Java(JRuby) and .Net(IronRuby).

<h2 id='thoughts_on_the_amazon_kindle'><a href='/2011/04/26/thoughts-on-the-kindle.html'>Thoughts on the Amazon Kindle</a></h2>
<p>I love reading - I love fiction, I love technical literature, I love newspapers and magazines. I&#8217;m also a bit of old fashioned - I love the feel and smell of paper, I love the ability to feel the pages. So it took me quite some time to convince myself to buy one of the fabled Amazon Kindle e-book reading devices. People often ask me what I think about it and would I recommend them to buy one so I decided to write down my thoughts here.</p><h2 id='the_things_i_love_about_the_kindle'>The things I love about the Kindle</h2><hr /><h1 id='typography'>Typography</h1><p>The typography of the fiction books on the Kindle is simply amazing - the fonts and the typesetting are close to perfect. The only thing that is a bit off is the justification of some lines but this happens very rarely. Most of the paper books I&#8217;ve recently bought have so terrible typography that they simply appal me.</p><h1 id='quality_of_images'>Quality of images</h1><p>This one really surprised me - the images and photos look very good on the Kindle(unless they are very big and have to be scaled down).</p><h1 id='navigation'>Navigation</h1><p>The navigation is outstanding - I think the idea to double the buttons for forward/backward page was a brilliant one. The ability to skip chapters and to easily navigate the table of contents is fairly handy as well. Unfortunately not all mobi books are created with an useful table of contents, but this is not a problem of the Kindle itself.</p><h1 id='builtin_dictionary'>Built-in dictionary</h1><p>Although my knowledge of English is considered quite considerable I&#8217;m no native speaker and when I read fancy books from time to time I encounter words I do not know. Having the built-in dictionary I can just move the cursor to the word in question and I see its meaning inline. This is so very cool!</p><h1 id='weight__size'>Weight &amp; size</h1><p>The Kindle is smaller and lighter than most paperbacks. And you can carry literary hundreds of books on your kindle.</p><h1 id='battery_life'>Battery life</h1><p>Without the wireless the battery lasts for about a month&#8230;</p><h1 id='amazon_kindle_store'>Amazon Kindle store</h1><p>It&#8217;s so easy to find and buy the books you want. You have the option to buy something from the website and it will be automatically sent to your Kindle or you can find and buy books from the Kindle itself if you&#8217;re connected to the Internet.</p><h1 id='free_3g'>Free 3G</h1><p>The Amazon Kindle store is always at hand.</p><h1 id='the_official_lighted_leather_cover'>The official lighted leather cover</h1><p>The <a href='http://www.amazon.co.uk/Kindle-Lighted-Leather-Display-Generation/dp/B003DZ165W/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1303826907&amp;sr=8-1'>cover</a> is made of leather and makes the Kindle appearance quite similar to that of a real book. It also features LED light powered by the Kindle itself with which you can easily read even in the darkest places. Unfortunately it&#8217;s very expensive - it costs half as much as the Kindle&#8230;</p><h1 id='eink_screen'>E-ink screen</h1><p>Looks like a real book, immune to sunlight, great contrast.</p><h1 id='collections'>Collections</h1><p>You can organise your books into collections on various criteria.</p><h1 id='ebooks_are_generally_cheaper'>Ebooks are generally cheaper</h1><p>This is not true for all books(at least not yet). At least you save the shipping expenses(if you have any).</p><h1 id='highlights_and_sharing'>Highlights and sharing</h1><p>You can see passages other people highlighted as interesting and add highlights and notes yourself. You can also tweet passages and stuff like that. The Kindle is social&#8230;</p><h2 id='the_things_i_dont_like'>The things I don&#8217;t like</h2><hr /><h1 id='pdf_support'>PDF support</h1><p>It&#8217;s so horrible I can barely describe it. Basically PDF are unreadable and everyone that tell you otherwise is lying to you. The Kindle DX is large enough to accommodate PDF I guess, but not the normal Kindle.</p><h1 id='formatting_is_terrible_in_technical_books'>Formatting is terrible in technical books</h1><p>If you read a lot of books with diagrams, tables, source code, etc the Kindle is not for you(or at least not for that task). Everything is scrambled and confusing. Basically this and the previous item made me buy an iPad 2 for reading PDFs and technical books.</p><h1 id='the_web_browser_is_mostly_useless'>The web browser is mostly useless</h1><p>The Kindle has an experimental web browser, which is mostly useless mainly due to the inherent limitation of the e-ink screen(such a enormous refresh rate).</p><h1 id='real_page_numbers'>Real page numbers</h1><p>The ability to cross reference paper pages with ebook pages was added in a recent firmware update, but I haven&#8217;t seen any books that have those page markers.</p><h1 id='keyboard'>Keyboard</h1><p>Mostly useless, probably a future version with some touchscreen display would drop it. It just takes up valuable place.</p><h1 id='screen_is_not_touch_sensitive'>Screen is not touch sensitive</h1><p>In the first day I owned the devices I often tried to turn pages by swiping the screen. I&#8217;m quite fond of touch screen interfaces and one of those can make the Kindle even smaller.</p><h1 id='magazines_and_newspapers_are_crippled'>Magazines and newspapers are crippled</h1><p>Because the publishers have to pay some fee to amazon based on the traffic they generate with their magazines/newspapers the Kindle version are generally stripped down from a lot of images and other content.</p><h1 id='no_easy_way_to_lendborrow_books'>No easy way to lend/borrow books</h1><p>Currently we have services like lendle.me, but they have a very limited library. Soon the Kindle will have built-in lending support and this will improve the situation immensely.</p><h2 id='conclusion'>Conclusion</h2><hr /><p>Basically the Kindle is the greatest thing after hot water for people that read a lot of fiction books. Everyone else should consider buying a tablet.</p><div style='font-style: italic; color: #7f9f7f;'>Posted on 26 Apr 2011 by Bozhidar.</div>

<h2 id='incremental_development_with_scala_and_jrebel'><a href='/2011/04/26/jrebel-with-scala.html'>Incremental development with Scala and JRebel</a></h2>
<p>One of the things I love most about Lisp development is the ability to develop applications in an incremental interactive manner - you write one function, compile it, load into your current REPL session, make some adjustments and repeat this process until you get satisfactory results. You never stop to compile your project, you never have to restart your application server. Without those distractions it&#8217;s easier to maintain your concentration and to remain in the <em>flow</em>.</p><p>With languages like Scala and Java, however, you cannot do this - at least without a bit of external help. This help comes in the form of an application called <a href='http://www.zeroturnaround.com/jrebel/'>JRebel</a>, which basically reloads the classes in your program as you make changes to them and recompile them. JRebel is a commercial application and generally you have to pay to use it&#8230; unless you want to you use it for Scala development, that is. ZeroTurnaround(the company that makes JRebel) offers <a href='http://sales.zeroturnaround.com/wp-content/themes/zeroturnaround4.0/modals/applyForLicense.php'>free licences to Scala developers</a> and if you&#8217;re one of them you should definitely get one.</p><p>Installing JRebel is trivial - generally you have to only extract a zip file(or use an installer) somewhere and drop in the JRebel folder the licence file that they have e-mail you. Afterwards you simply have to integrate JRebel with your build system. JRebel can also be integrated with IDEs, but I want cover this here. I use mostly <a href='http://maven.apache.org'>Maven 3</a> and <a href='http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/'>SBT</a> so I&#8217;ll show you what to do for them. With Maven you have to add the following to the <em>$MAVEN_OPTS</em> environmental variable:</p><div class='highlight'><pre><code class='console'><span class='go'>export MAVEN_OPTS=-noverify -javaagent:/home/bozhidar/work/jrebel/jrebel.jar</span>
</code></pre>
</div><p>Since most people use JRebel for web development to avoid the need to restart their application containers and Scala&#8217;s most prominent framework is <a href='http://liftweb.net'>Lift</a> you&#8217;d probably want to enable the JRebel Lift plug-in as well:</p><div class='highlight'><pre><code class='console'><span class='go'>export MAVEN_OPTS=-noverify -javaagent:/home/bozhidar/work/jrebel/jrebel.jar</span>
<span class='go'> -Drebel.lift_plugin=true</span>
</code></pre>
</div><p>Stick this in your shell&#8217;s init file and source it to make it available in the shell.</p><p>Now when you start your web app with</p><div class='highlight'><pre><code class='console'><span class='go'>mvn jetty:run</span>
</code></pre>
</div><p>And the continuous Scala compilation with</p><div class='highlight'><pre><code class='console'><span class='go'>mvn scala:cc</span>
</code></pre>
</div><p>The compiler with pickup the changes you made and JRebel will reload the changed classes behind the scenes. The development process this way starts to feel a bit like using a scripting language such as Ruby or PHP.</p><p>If you&#8217;re using SBT you should modify the sbt startup script to include the same options that I mentioned in the section about Maven configuration. Mine sbt script looks like this:</p><div class='highlight'><pre><code class='console'><span class='gp'>#</span>!/bin/bash

<span class='go'>java -noverify -javaagent:/home/bozhidar/work/jrebel/jrebel.jar</span>
<span class='go'> -Drebel.lift_plugin=true -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled</span>
<span class='go'> -XX:MaxPermSize=512m -Xmx512M -Xss2M -jar `dirname $0`/sbt-launch.jar</span>
<span class='go'> &quot;$@&quot;</span>
</code></pre>
</div><p>Another use for JRebel is the Scala REPL itself. When you start the REPL from inside SBT for instance with the command:</p><div class='highlight'><pre><code class='console'><span class='go'>sbt console</span>
</code></pre>
</div><p>changes to the imported classes will be reflected automatically without the need to do a <em>:replay</em> or restart the REPL - something reminiscent of the interactive Lisp programming I mentioned earlier.</p><p>So what are you waiting for? Go grab JRebel and speed up your Scala development process.</p><div style='font-style: italic; color: #7f9f7f;'>Posted on 26 Apr 2011 by Bozhidar.</div>
