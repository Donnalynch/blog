<h1 id="overture">Overture</h1>

<p>Back in the day when Ruby wasn’t particularly popular outside Japan
there was only one book in English about Ruby -
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Ruby-1-9-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/1934356085/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1305641089&amp;sr=1-1">“Programming Ruby”</a>, affectionately called the Pickaxe by most
Rubyists. Those day are long gone now. Ruby on Rails propelled Ruby
into the mainstream and quite a few books on Ruby (and Rails) have
been published over the past five or so years. With so many books to
choose from developers often find it hard to pick up the <em>right</em> book.</p>

<p>In this post I’ll share with you my thoughts on the Ruby books that I’ve found
to be the most interesting and valuable. Feel free to disagree with
me, after all this is a highly subjective matter.</p>

<h1 id="beginner-books">Beginner books</h1>

<p>Every saga has a beginning, every journey has a first step, every
programming language has a first book…</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/ltp2/learn-to-program">Learn to Program</a></strong></p>

<p>A book that teaches programming to absolute beginners with Ruby as the
implementation language. I haven’t read this book (only excerpts from
it), but I’ve used it as a gift for several acquaintances of mine, with the
desire to learn to program. All of them were frustrated by other
introductory books they’ve read and all of them praised “Learn to
Program” for its immense clarity, engaging and enjoyable style and
comprehensible examples.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1933988657/ref=s9_simh_gw_p14_d0_i7?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=center-2&amp;pf_rd_r=0Q48PY008200T745JZSF&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=470938631&amp;pf_rd_i=507846">The Well Grounded Rubyist</a></strong></p>

<p>“The Well Grounded Rubyist” is a thoroughly revised and updated edition
of the older book Ruby for Rails (which was 90% Ruby and 10% Rails). In this new book, author David
A. Black moves beyond Rails and presents a broader view of Ruby. It
covers Ruby 1.9 in great detail, unlike many introductory texts that
tend to offer only superficial coverage of many topics.</p>

<p>Starting with the basics, The Well-Grounded Rubyist explains Ruby
objects and their interactions from the ground up. In the middle
chapters, the book turns to an examination of Ruby’s built-in, core
classes, showing the reader how to manipulate strings, numbers,
arrays, ranges, hashes, sets, and more. Regular expressions get
attention, as do file and other I/O operations. At 500+ pages it’s a
bit of a hefty tome, but it’s definitely worth reading it.</p>

<h1 id="reference-books">Reference books</h1>

<p>Reference books are not usually the biggest fun to read, but they tend
to cover everything a language has to offer and we generally keep them
close. Their value increases with the increase of our knowledge of a
particular language.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ruby-Programming-Language-David-Flanagan/dp/0596516177">The Ruby Programming Language</a></strong></p>

<p>Co-authored by Ruby’s creator Matz this is without a doubt the best
analysis of the languages. Everything you need to know is explained in
a crisp and easy to comprehend manner. The thing I liked most about the
book was the depth in which all the topics were discussed - given the
superficial coverage of some topics (such as encodings) in other books,
this book really stands out. The book is full of examples and
artwork by <em>why the lucky stiff</em>, and covers both Ruby 1.8 and 1.9. The
chapters on proc &amp; clojures and metaprogramming were particularly
strong. The books is geared mostly towards experienced programmers who
are new to Ruby. If you’re one of them - it’s unlikely you’ll find a
better starting point in your journey to Ruby mastery.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Ruby-1-9-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/1934356085/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1305636206&amp;sr=1-1">Programming Ruby</a></strong></p>

<p>Co-authored by the Pragmatic Programmers themselves (Dave Thomas &amp;
Andy Hunt) this was the very first English book on Ruby (and arguably
an instrument in Ruby’s international success). The first edition of
the books is freely available on-line, but it’s very outdated so I
wouldn’t recommend you to read it. The book has two parts
- a tutorial part and a reference part. </p>

<p>The tutorial part is very well written and quite readable. It’s geared
towards less experienced developers and you’ll not find as detailed
coverage of the topics as in “The Ruby Programming Language”. You’ll,
however, find full coverage of everything new in Ruby 1.9 - the book includes all the new and changed syntax and
semantics introduced since Ruby 1.8 and information about the new parameter
passing rules, local variable scoping in blocks, fibers,
multinationalization, and the new block declaration syntax.  </p>

<p>The reference part of the book includes a description of all the
standard library modules, a complete reference for all built-in classes
and modules (including all the new and changed methods introduced by
Ruby 1.9). </p>

<p>I’m not sure we need the whole Ruby standard library documentation on
paper anymore in the age of the Internet, but I guess some people will
find it helpful. I just feel that the additional documentation simply
made the book heavier (and possibly pricier).</p>

<h1 id="intermediate-ruby-books">Intermediate Ruby books</h1>

<p>Once you’ve read a reference or a beginner’s Ruby book you might want
to move to some book that illustrates common Ruby style, techniques
and idioms. </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ruby-Best-Practices-Gregory-Brown/dp/0596523009/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1305640369&amp;sr=8-1">Ruby Best Practices</a></strong></p>

<p>“Ruby Best Practices” is aimed at programmers who want to use Ruby as
experienced Rubyists do. Written by the developer of the Ruby project
Prawn, this concise book explains how to design beautiful APIs and
domain-specific languages with Ruby, as well as how to work with
functional programming ideas and techniques that can simplify your
code and make you more productive. You’ll learn how to write code
that’s readable and expressive.</p>

<p>The whole book is currently available from free
<a href="http://blog.rubybestpractices.com/posts/gregory/022-rbp-now-open.html">on-line</a>
and has a very nice companion <a href="http://blog.rubybestpractices.com/">blog</a>.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Eloquent-Ruby-Addison-Wesley-Professional/dp/0321584104/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1305640620&amp;sr=1-1">Eloquent Ruby</a></strong></p>

<p>The latest (and one of the greatest) Ruby books I’ve read. The book
pretty much has the same aim as “Ruby Best Practices”, but covers a lot
more ground and is generally a lighter and more enjoyable read. Russ
Olson has a very particular writing style that turns even the most
boring subjects into interesting discussions. All chapters feature
some real world examples of the concepts introduced, and a discussion
of potential pitfalls.</p>

<p>Very highly recommended second Ruby book.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Ruby-Russ-Olsen/dp/0321490452/ref=pd_sim_b_6">Design Patterns in Ruby</a></strong></p>

<p>A most enjoyable rendition of a generally boring subject by Russ Olson. “Design
Patterns in Ruby” explores 14 of the classical GoF design patterns and
compares the canonical implementation of the patterns to idiomatic
Ruby versions of them. Every pattern features a discussion of common
use cases, pitfalls and real world usages.</p>

<p>The book also builds on top of the original patterns by adding a
couple of new ones like DSL and Convention over configuration.</p>

<p>Without a doubt one of the best Design pattern books and a must read
for all Ruby hackers. You don’t need any previous knowledge of design
patterns prior to reading this book, but there are a lot of references
to the classic GoF text so you might want to read it beforehand.</p>

<h1 id="advanced-ruby-books">Advanced Ruby books</h1>

<p>At some point you might want to explore some of the darker corners of Ruby.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Metaprogramming-Ruby-Program-Like-Pros/dp/1934356476/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1305641577&amp;sr=1-1">Metaprogramming in Ruby</a></strong></p>

<p>The ability to modify programs at runtime is one the greatest
strengths of Ruby, but it seems to frighten a lot of people (which is
understandable given the constant usage of fancy words like
eigenclass). If you want to sharpen your Ruby metaprogramming skills -
this is the one true book. </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Using-JRuby-Bringing-Ruby-Facets/dp/1934356654/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1305641415&amp;sr=1-1">Using JRuby: Bringing Ruby to Java</a></strong></p>

<p>Believe it or not currently JRuby seems to be best Ruby implementation
around. If you’re interested in using JRuby you’d do well to learn
more about the integration with the JVM that JRuby provides as well as
the various new deployment options that JRuby introduces. </p>

<p>This book was written by the core JRuby developers and it’s absolutely
excellent. Clear and concise writing style, lots of useful examples.</p>

<h1 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h1>

<p>There are certainly other great Ruby books around that I haven’t read,
but I guess that at some point reading books is just not as helpful as
writing real code. I do believe, however, that even experienced
developers can benefit from a good programming book.</p>

<p>So, which Ruby books that I’ve missed would you recommend?</p>

<h2 id="javanext---clojure-the-return-of-the-lispersclojurejava20110512jvm-langs-clojurehtml"><a href="/Clojure/Java/2011/05/12/jvm-langs-clojure.html">Java.next() - Clojure: The Return of the Lispers</a></h2>
<h1 id="overture">Overture</h1>

<p>This is the third part of the series of <strong>Java.next()</strong>. Last time
we’ve discussed the merits of <a href="/Java/Scala/2011/05/08/jvm-langs-scala.html">Scala</a> - an OO language with a strong
emphasis on functional and parallel programming. Today we’ll be
discussing Clojure - a language that pushes the envelop a lot further
than Scala as far as functional and parallel programming are
concerned. You’ll see that Clojure is radically different from Scala
and Groovy in many aspects - it’s not an OO language, it doesn’t have
Algol-derived syntax and it introduces a few rather radical ideas on
subjects such as <a href="http://clojure.org/state">identity and state</a>.</p>

<p>Clojure’s approach to concurrency is characterized by the concept of
identities, which represent a series of immutable states over
time. Since states are immutable values, any number of workers can
operate on them in parallel, and concurrency becomes a question of
managing changes from one state to another. For this purpose, Clojure
provides several mutable reference types, each having well-defined
semantics for the transition between states. This is a pretty complex
topic for a language overview so I’ll discuss it here only cursory.</p>

<p>Clojure was initially conceived as targeting both the JVM and the
CLR. For various reason currently the core development team is targeting mainly
the JVM and the <a href="https://github.com/richhickey/clojure-clr">CLR port</a>
is receiving less attention (though it’s not abandoned and it’s
regularly being updated). Like Scala it’s not technically correct to
call it a JVM languages, because it’s both a JVM and a .Net language,
but since it’s used a lot more often with Java it doesn’t make that
much of a difference.</p>

<h1 id="a-brief-history-of-clojure">A brief history of Clojure</h1>

<p>Clojure is a very young project (compared to most popular
programming languages at least). It was created in 2007 by Rich
Hickey (project leader and benevolent dictator for life). He developed
Clojure because he wanted a modern Lisp for functional programming,
symbiotic with the established Java platform, and designed for
concurrency. What started as a hobby project turned into some much
bigger with Rich getting so excited about the project that left his
job to work full-time on the project, effectively through burning his life’s
savings in the process. This was quite the gamble, but it turned out
to be a lucky one, since Clojure’s popularity rapidly spiked and
loyal and energetic community was quickly formed around the project. </p>

<p>Clojure became the new language of choice for many well respected
hackers from different communities. I’ve noticed something of a trend
in that department - most Clojure hackers used to be Ruby hackers. I
guess some of the Ruby hackers were not satisfied by partial subset of
Lisp features, available in Ruby, and wanted to gain access to all of
Lisp’s power.</p>

<p>The current Clojure version is 1.2 with 1.3 being just around the
corner.</p>

<h1 id="installing-clojure">Installing Clojure</h1>

<p><em>Before installing Clojure make sure you have Java installed. Java 5.0
SE will do, but Java 6 SE is highly recommended.</em></p>

<p>Installing Clojure is just a matter of downloading and extracting a
single archive -
<a href="http://github.com/downloads/clojure/clojure/clojure-1.2.0.zip">clojure.zip</a>. Many
high quality Clojure libraries come prepackaged in another archived
named
<a href="http://github.com/downloads/clojure/clojure-contrib/clojure-contrib-1.2.0.zip">Clojure Contrib</a>. Clojure
Contrib is kind of a staging area for Clojure development - it’s a
common practice to move some of the best parts of contrib into core.</p>

<p>In the directory in which you expanded clojure.zip, run:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="gp">$</span> java -cp clojure.jar clojure.main
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This will bring up a simple read-eval-print loop (REPL) a.k.a. an
interactive console. Much of
Clojure is defined in Clojure itself (in the <strong>core.clj</strong> file included in
the src directory of distribution), which is automatically loaded from
the .jar file when Clojure starts. The file <strong>user.clj</strong>, if found in the
classpath, will be auto-loaded as well. You can leverage this to cause
code to run when Clojure starts. Reading the code in core.clj is a
very good way to get started with language and see how real Clojure
hackers work.</p>

<p>When core.clj is loaded you will have the language as described herein fully available.
Try:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="clojure"><span class="nv">user=&gt;</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">+ </span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="mi">6</span>
<span class="nv">user=&gt;</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">println </span><span class="s">&quot;Hello, Clojure!&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nv">Hello,</span> <span class="nv">Clojure!</span>
<span class="nv">nil</span>
<span class="nv">user=&gt;</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">javax</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nv">swing</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nv">JOptionPane/showMessageDialog</span> <span class="nv">nil</span> <span class="s">&quot;Hello World&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The REPL has very rudimentary editing. For a better experience, try running it via the <a href="http://jline.sourceforge.net/">JLine</a> ConsoleRunner:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="go">java -cp jline-0_9_5.jar:clojure.jar jline.ConsoleRunner clojure.main</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This will give you left/right arrow key navigation and up/down arrow
command history.</p>

<p>Later on we’ll see how to setup a real Clojure development environment
in which you’ll be able to leverage the full power of the Clojure REPL
and interactive programming.</p>

<h1 id="did-you-say-clojure-was-a-lisp">Did you say Clojure was a Lisp???</h1>

<p>Most developers tend to have a very negative attitude towards the word
<strong>Lisp</strong> in general. I guess it spawns all kinds of nasty associations in
their brains - like prefix syntax notation, tons of parentheses and a
lot of crap they heard about Lisp from their 70 year-old professor,
teaching introduction to functional programming in college, whose
notion of functional programming is that in Lisp everything is a
function (believe me when I tell you this - such professors do exist).</p>

<p>You know, I wasn’t born coding in Lisp myself. I was initially
exposed to Lisp when I tried to learn the Emacs text editor and I was
baffled by many things - the strange syntax, the talk about atoms and
lists, code as data, macros, continuation, tail-call optimizations,
what to quote and that to evaluate, what is a s-expression and what
isa form. To put it shortly - I was like
Alice down the rabbit whole or like Neo when he found out what the
Matrix is… The world of programming that I was familiar with was
turned upside down.</p>

<p>The interesting thing is that I felt similarly when I learnt my first
programming language Pascal in the 8th grade. It’s not that Lisp is
any harder than the other programming languages - it’s just that it’s
different and you’re usually approaching it from a position in which
you know one or several programming languages, using the much more
widespread Algol syntax. I advise you to simply keep an open mind while
you read this article and don’t just dismiss Clojure because of its
Lisp heritage.</p>

<p>You likely know at least one person who constantly keeps telling
you how Lisp is the one true programming language, how everything
pales next to it and how Lisp is the actual answer to that fundamental
question about the life, the universe and everything else (not
42). These people might very well be telling the truth, but their
zealous rants tend to create a negative attitude towards the Lisp
community as well. Please, ignore them.</p>

<p>Now it’s time to take the red pill… So fasten your seat-belt
Dorothy, ‘cause Kansas is going bye-bye! </p>

<h1 id="clojure-at-a-glance">Clojure at a glance</h1>

<p><em>Mutable state is the new spaghetti code!</em> - Rich Hickey, creator of Clojure</p>

<p><em>Time is the new memory!</em> - Rich Hickey</p>

<p><em>Clojure feels like a general-purpose language beamed back from the
near future. Its support for functional programming and software
transactional memory is well beyond current practice and is well
suited for multicore hardware. At the same time, Clojure is well
grounded in the past and the present. It brings together Lisp and the
Java Virtual Machine. Lisp brings wisdom spanning most of the history
of programming, and Java brings the robustness, extensive libraries,
and tooling of the dominant platform available today.</em> - Stuart
Halloway, author of
<a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/shcloj/programming-clojure">“Programming Clojure”</a></p>

<p>If I had only a few minutes to describe Clojure this would be the gist
of it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dynamic language for the JVM
    <ul>
      <li>Clojure uses dynamic typing like languages such Ruby and Python
and a very smart compiler that will generally generate very
efficient bytecode. If you want to push the performance envelope even
further you can add some explicit type hints in your Clojure
code to ensure the generation of even faster bytecode.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Lisp reloaded
    <ul>
      <li>Clojure is Lisp down to its core - it has all the features that
are known and loved, and in the same time it improves upon them in
several ways - for instance we have a literal syntax for most
common collection types. Sure - with Common Lisp’s reader macros
one can do this as well, but nobody bothers to…</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Elegant
    <ul>
      <li>Clojure code tends to be very concise, but very readable non the
less. A core idea in Clojure is to strip the incidental
complexity of problems solving and to be able to just solve the
problems straight away without much ceremony.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Functional
    <ul>
      <li>Clojure puts heavy emphasis on functional programming, but it’s
a practical functional programming language - not a pure one
like Haskell. Clojure acknowledges that some stuff simply change
and operations have to generally produce some effects, and makes
those things easy to model. Clojure has a library full of
rock-solid immutable data structures, relies heavily on lazy
evaluation, tail-recursion and higher-order functions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Designed with concurrency in mind
    <ul>
      <li>Clojure has an extensive built-in high-level facilities to deal
with concurrent access to data and parallel programming in general.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Fast
    <ul>
      <li>Unlike many dynamic languages (even those running on top the
JVM) Clojure is quite fast - it some scenarios it’s performance
can rival that of a statically type language. You can browse a
long list of
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2186709/are-there-any-good-clojure-benchmarks">benchmark comparisons</a>
to verify this statement. Given the fact that performance if
often cited as a big drawback of dynamic languages, this is
quite the win for Clojure.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Capable of easily leveraging existing Java code
    <ul>
      <li>Using Java code from Clojure is direct, easy and
idiomatic. There are no intermediate layers or the need to
write wrapper for everything.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I’ll discuss in greater detail some of those features as I moving along.</p>

<h1 id="a-whirlwind-tour-of-clojure">A whirlwind tour of Clojure</h1>

<p><strong>Clojure is elegant</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Removes a lot of accidental complexity</li>
  <li>Clojure programs are generally expressive and concise</li>
  <li>Concise programs are naturally easier to understand and maintain</li>
</ul>

<p>Consider this Java example from our Scala discussion:</p>

<p>As a reader pointed out using the third party Guava library the code
can be reduced to:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="java"><span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kt">boolean</span> <span class="nf">hasUpperCase</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">word</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>

                    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nf">isUpperCase</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">c</span><span class="o">);</span>
                <span class="o">}</span>
            <span class="o">})</span>
        <span class="k">else</span>
            <span class="k">return</span> <span class="kc">false</span><span class="o">;</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>It still looks quite ugly to me. For the sake of comparison here’s the
Clojure version:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="clojure"><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">defn </span><span class="nv">has-uppercase?</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">string</span><span class="p">]</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">some </span><span class="o">#</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">Character/isUpperCase</span> <span class="nv">%</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="nv">string</span><span class="p">))</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The definition of the problems is “A string has an uppercase character if
some of the characters in it is uppercase” (doesn’t sound good, but
will do). The Clojure code reads more or less like the definition of
the problem. A finer point is that it will work correctly even if you
pass <strong>nil</strong> to the has-uppercase? function.</p>

<p><strong>Clojure is concise</strong></p>

<p>We already saw in the previous example the conciseness of Clojure
code, but here we’ll add another example. This is Java:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="java"><span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">Person</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="kd">private</span> <span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">name</span><span class="o">;</span>
    <span class="kd">private</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">age</span><span class="o">;</span>

    <span class="n">Person</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">name</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">age</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
        <span class="k">this</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">name</span><span class="o">;</span>
        <span class="k">this</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">age</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">age</span><span class="o">;</span>
    <span class="o">}</span>

    <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="n">String</span> <span class="nf">getName</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">name</span><span class="o">;</span>
    <span class="o">}</span>

    <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">setName</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">name</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
        <span class="k">this</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">name</span><span class="o">;</span>
    <span class="o">}</span>

    <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">getAge</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">age</span><span class="o">;</span>
    <span class="o">}</span>

    <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">setAge</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">age</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>

    <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>In Clojure you’d probably model this class like this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="clojure"><span class="nv">user&gt;</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">defrecord</span> <span class="nv">person</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">name</span> <span class="nv">age</span><span class="p">])</span>

<p>Clojure’s version of the type is a one liner and remain shorter even
with a few examples of its usage. It’s not equivalent to Java
definition, however - the Clojure version of the structure is
immutable.</p>

<p><strong>Clojure is a Lisp</strong></p>

<p>For better or for worse Clojure is a Lisp dialect and we should accept
this. I have always viewed Lisp as weapon from a more elegant era when
people were more concerned with elements of style and empowering the
developers to easily translate their thoughts into programs. For one
reason or another every Lisp dialect has failed to capture the
attention of a critical mass of developers that may propel it into the
mainstream. This, of course, doesn’t mean that existing Lisp dialects
should be considered a failure. Scheme (the dialect that has probably
had the greatest impact on Clojure’s design) was designed to be as
simple as possible so it could be appropriate as a teaching tool - in
that area Scheme certainly excelled. Common Lisp was created to bring
together the various Lisp dialects under a common denominator and it
also excelled in that endeavour. I guess that its creators hoped that
it would capture a significant market share at some point as well, but alas -
that never happened. </p>

<p>The syntax and programming model of Lisp so far have been too much for
a typical developer to absorb. Yet, there’s something special about
Lisp that’s worth revisiting, so the new dialects continue to
emerge. Some of the best programming universities start teaching
programming with the Lisp language to form young minds while they are
still open. I have witnessed something of a cycle - every 5 or so
years the interest in Lisp spikes because of something major that
happened in the land of Lisp. In the beginning of the nineties the
work on Common Lisp excited a lot of developers. Five years later Paul
Graham took the stage - he showed the world how Lisp can empower small
teams and make real money (if you haven’t heard of Viaweb fire up
google now). Five years ago Peter Seibel published the
“Practical Common Lisp” book that appeared on Amazon’s bestseller list
and got a lot of new developers excited about Lisp. A now… well I
guess you can figure that one out on your own.</p>

<p>Lisp just won’t let go and die. There is something magical about
it. And there is this inexplicable smugness on the face of Lisp
developers…</p>

<p>So let’s review the typical Lisp features that are present in Clojure:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lisp-1 dialect
    <ul>
      <li>This means that functions and variables share the same
namespace, unlike in dialects like Common Lisp. Both approaches
have their merits and drawbacks as usual. In Clojure you cannot
have a variable named the say way as a function, but you can
pass function names around without any special syntax. In Common
Lisp you can have function and variables sharing the same name,
but you have to mark functions explicitly when you’re passing
them around (with the #’ reader macro or the <strong>function</strong> function).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Dynamic - both in term of dynamic typing and dynamic
development. Lisp is the language that made popular the technique of
incremental interactive development (we’ll talk about it more in a bit)</li>
  <li>Code is data
    <ul>
      <li>List code is defined in term of Lisp data structures. When the
reader read the source code of the application it converts it to
standard Lisp objects and they represent the program. No special
transformations, no AST. This is the heart of Lisp macros and a
centrepiece in Lisp philosophy.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Reader
    <ul>
      <li>The reader can read valid Clojure forms and translate them into
Clojure objects - object, function call, everything that has a
readable representation</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Small core, next to none syntax
    <ul>
      <li>In terms of compact syntax and uniformity of the syntax it has
always been hard to beat Lisp. Most programming languages are
full of special syntax constructs, keywords, etc. In lisp
programs are just lists and the low-level plumbing comes in the
form of special functions called special forms. Everything else
is implemented in terms of those special forms. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Sequences
    <ul>
      <li>Clojure abstracts common collection traits into an abstraction
called seq which allows you to use a similar API for many tasks</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Macros
    <ul>
      <li>Forget about C macros, Word macros, editor macros. Lisp macros
are the most powerful metaprogramming technique out there - they
enable you generate new syntax abstractions unlike anything
else. If you need a new operator in Java you’d have a hard time
convincing the guys in Oracle to add it for you. With Lisp
you’re in charge and you can define any syntax abstractions that
you wish. As an appetiser consider the <strong>and</strong> boolean
statement. In most languages it’s built into the language
itself. In Clojure it’s just a short macro:</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I hope this example gives you an idea about the power that Clojure
offers you - you can be more than just a programmer; you can be the
language designer.</p>

<h1 id="persistent-data-structures">Persistent data structures</h1>

<p>Data structures in Clojure are immutable. Operations executed on them
return a new data structure of the same type instead of modifying the
structure in place. Understandably most people are immediately
concerned about the performance implications of such a technique -
this seems like quite a lot of overhead. They needn’t worry, though.</p>

<p>Data structures in Clojure happen to be persistent as well. A persistent data
structure is a data structure which always preserves the previous
version of itself when it is modified -  such data structures are
effectively immutable, as their operations do not (visibly) update the
structure in-place, but instead always yield a new updated
structure. A persistent data structure is not a data structure
committed to persistent storage, such as a disk; this is a different
and unrelated sense of the word “persistent”.</p>

<p>Persistent data structures save a lot of copying around and improve
greatly the performance. Knowing this should be enough for most
developers, those that are more curious can find a lot of interesting
articles on the subject on-line.</p>

<p>The core data structures in Clojure are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>List</li>
  <li>Set - all the items in it are unique</li>
  <li>Map - also known as associative array and dictionary in other languages</li>
  <li>Vector - also know as one dimensional array</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s see them in action:</p>

<p>Most data structures in Clojure are part of a common Sequence API,
that we’ll briefly discuss shortly.</p>

<h1 id="the-seq-api">The Seq API</h1>

<p>Clojure defines many algorithms in terms of sequences (seqs). A seq is
a logical list, and unlike most Lisps where the list is represented by
a concrete, 2-slot structure, Clojure uses the ISeq interface to allow
many data structures to provide access to their elements as
sequences. The <strong>seq</strong> function yields an implementation of ISeq
appropriate to the collection. Seqs differ from iterators in that they
are persistent and immutable, not stateful cursors into a
collection. As such, they are useful for much more than foreach -
functions can consume and produce seqs, they are thread safe, they can
share structure, etc.</p>

<p>Most of the sequence library functions are lazy, i.e. functions that
return seqs do so incrementally, as they are consumed, and thus
consume any seq arguments incrementally as well. Functions returning
lazy seqs can be implemented using the <strong>lazy-seq</strong> macro. The laziness
allows us to deal with infinite data structures easily (as long as we
don’t try to act on all of their elements that is):</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="clojure"><span class="nv">user&gt;</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">take </span><span class="mi">10</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">filter </span><span class="nv">even?</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">iterate </span><span class="nv">inc</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)))</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span> <span class="mi">4</span> <span class="mi">6</span> <span class="mi">8</span> <span class="mi">10</span> <span class="mi">12</span> <span class="mi">14</span> <span class="mi">16</span> <span class="mi">18</span> <span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><strong>iterate</strong> returns an infinite lazy sequence. <strong>filter</strong> returns a lazy
sequence as well. With <strong>take</strong> we can take only the elements we need
without have to process the entire infinite collection.</p>

<h1 id="functional-programing-with-clojure">Functional programing with Clojure</h1>

<p>Clojure is a functional programming language and as such it offers quite
the selection of features that make it easy to leverage the functional
programming techniques. </p>

<ul>
  <li>functions are objects</li>
  <li>all built-in data structures are immutable</li>
  <li>most functions in the core library are pure (they don’t produce any
side results and they don’t interact with the outside world in any
manner other than just receiving their parameters from it)</li>
  <li>there are no iteration constructs like <strong>for</strong> and <strong>while</strong> in
other languages. In place of iteration list comprehensions and
recursion are commonly used.</li>
  <li>everything is an expression that yields some result - even things
that are traditionally statements in other languages such as <strong>if</strong> and
<strong>print</strong> (although the return value of print is not particularly useful)</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="parallel-programming">Parallel programming</h1>

<p>Functional programming and parallel programming complement each
other. When most of your code is contained in pure functions it’s
naturally tread safe (not to mention much easier to test). Since you
don’t have any mutable state there, it’s absolutely safe to fire those
pure functions in as many threads as you wish and you’ll have
absolutely nothing to worry about.</p>

<p>Programs, however, eventually produce side effects and often they
really have to have some mutable state. Clojure makes it easy to model
such situations in your programs in a way that doesn’t compromise the
ability to parallelize the programs. </p>

<p><strong>Refs and transactions</strong></p>

<p>Transactional references (known as refs in Clojure) ensure safe shared use of mutable
storage locations via a software transactional memory (STM)
system. Refs are bound to a single storage location for their
lifetime, and only allow mutation of that location to occur within a
transaction.</p>

<p>Clojure transactions should be easy to understand if you’ve ever used
database transactions - they ensure that all actions on refs are
atomic, consistent, and isolated. Atomic means that every change to
refs made within a transaction occurs or none do. Consistent means
that each new value can be checked with a validator function before
allowing the transaction to commit. Isolated means that no transaction
sees the effects of any other transaction while it is running. Another
feature common to STMs is that, should a transaction have a conflict
while running, it is automatically retried.</p>

<p>There are many ways to do STMs (locking/pessimistic,
lock-free/optimistic and hybrids) and it is still a research
problem. The Clojure STM uses multiversion concurrency control with
adaptive history queues for snapshot isolation, and provides a
distinct commute operation. Here’s a short example:</p>

<p>I hope you got the basic idea from this simple, but mostly useless
snippet. Generally when we have only one object that we’ll be changing
in this manner an atom is a more appropriate choice as we’ll see shortly.</p>

<p><strong>Agents</strong></p>

<p>Like <em>refs</em>, <em>agents</em> provide shared access to mutable state. Where refs
support coordinated, synchronous change of multiple locations, agents
provide independent, asynchronous change of individual
locations (to put it into simpler term you’d use refs if you had to
updated several things and wait for the update to happen and agents if
you need to update only one thing and don’t really care when the
update will happen - only that it will happen). Agents are bound to a single storage location for their
lifetime, and only allow mutation of that location (to a new state) to
occur as a result of an action. Actions are functions (with,
optionally, additional arguments) that are asynchronously applied to
an agent’s state and whose return value becomes the agent’s new
state. Let’s see an agent (Smith maybe?) in action:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="clojure"><span class="nv">user&gt;</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">def </span><span class="nv">some-agent</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">agent </span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">))</span>

               <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">send </span><span class="nv">some-agent</span> <span class="nv">inc</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="nv">nil</span>
<span class="nv">user&gt;</span> <span class="nv">some-agent</span>
<span class="o">#</span><span class="nv">&lt;Agent@15c024c:</span> <span class="mi">100</span><span class="nv">&gt;</span>
<span class="nv">user&gt;</span> <span class="nv">@some-agent</span>
<span class="mi">100</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><strong>Atoms</strong></p>

<p>Atoms provide a way to manage shared, synchronous, independent
state. They are a reference type like refs and vars. You create an
atom with atom, and can access its state with deref (or @). Let’s
rework the refs example to use an atom:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="clojure"><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">def </span><span class="nv">picked-numbers</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">atom</span> <span class="o">#</span><span class="p">{})</span>

<p><strong>Vars</strong></p>

<p>Bindings created with the <strong>binding</strong> macro cannot be seen by any other
thread. Bindings created with binding can be assigned to, which
provides a means for a nested context to communicate with code before
it on the call stack.</p>

<p>I’ll not be discussing them further, because Vars are a vast subject
deserving its own post.</p>

<h1 id="oop-lisp-style">OOP, Lisp style</h1>

<p>Object oriented programming in most programming languages is based on
a single dispatch message passing. The object on which we invoke a
method (poor choice of words, but easier to comprehend) is the
receiver, the method name and it’s arguments are the message. The
method’s invoked solely on the base of the type of the receiver
object.</p>

<p>Lisps have traditionally implemented OOP with generic methods, that
don’t have a receiver and are dispatched on the basis of the types of
all of their arguments. In the world of multiple dispatch the more
traditional single dispatch is just a special case in which only the
type of the first method argument matters. Here’s a taste of
multimethods in Clojure:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="clojure"><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">defmulti </span><span class="nv">my-add</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">fn </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">x</span> <span class="nv">y</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">and </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">string? </span><span class="nv">x</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">string? </span><span class="nv">y</span><span class="p">))))</span>

<span class="p">(</span><span class="k">defmethod </span><span class="nv">my-add</span> <span class="nv">true</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">x</span> <span class="nv">y</span><span class="p">]</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">str </span><span class="nv">x</span> <span class="nv">y</span><span class="p">))</span>

<span class="p">(</span><span class="k">defmethod </span><span class="nv">my-add</span> <span class="nv">false</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">x</span> <span class="nv">y</span><span class="p">]</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">+ </span><span class="nv">x</span> <span class="nv">y</span><span class="p">))</span>

</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Here we defined a multi-method that behaves differently for string and
numeric arguments - strings args are concatenated and numeric args are
added together.</p>

<h1 id="interactive-development">Interactive development</h1>

<p>Traditional programming languages have more or less the following work
flow:</p>

<ul>
  <li>write the unit tests (power to TDD)</li>
  <li>write the source file</li>
  <li>compile the source file (if needed)</li>
  <li>run the source file with an interpreter or run the binary file that
resulted from the compilation step</li>
  <li>if you need to modify something you edit the code and repeat the
other steps</li>
</ul>

<p>Those programs naturally have some entry points. Alternative you can
simple use the test suite you’ve initially developed.</p>

<p>A Lisp developers generally has a very different work flow:</p>

<ul>
  <li>start a REPL</li>
  <li>write some unit tests</li>
  <li>write a few functions definitions in a source file</li>
  <li>compile them interactively and load them in a REPL</li>
  <li>test these functions directly from the REPL</li>
  <li>if you need to modify a function - just edit it and reload in the
REPL</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve been a C/C++ and Java developer for a long time and I didn’t see
anything wrong with first model. In fact - I had been practising it
for so very long that it felt quite natural to me. After I’ve started
hacking with Lisp, however, my old work flow started to feel very
unproductive to me (especially with statically typed languages). Here
are some key aspects of the interactive (and iterative) development
that is so common in Lisp (not only in Common Lisp ;-) ):</p>

<ul>
  <li>The REPL is an integral process of the coding process. Ruby and
Python developers generally tend to use it only for exploratory
programming although many of the techniques common for Lisp could be
applied for Ruby and Python as well. </li>
  <li>Functions can be defined (and redefined) in real time</li>
  <li>Loading &amp; compilation of code at runtime</li>
  <li>Powerful introspection features</li>
  <li>Interactive development</li>
  <li>Iterative development - you know the old saying “Lather, rinse,
repeat…” (probably one of the oldest examples of recursion).</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="the-tools-of-the-trade">The tools of the trade</h1>

<p>The single biggest problem with Clojure in the moment (at least in my
opinion) has nothing to do with the language itself. The problem is
the lack of decent tooling and infrastructure around it. Lisp hackers
have traditionally favoured the SLIME development environment for
Emacs. Unfortunately the maintainers are not especially interested in
having Clojure support (since SLIME targets Common Lisp) and nobody in
Clojure community seems to be capable of writing an adequate swank
component for Clojure that can be used with an up-to-date version of
SLIME. The existing one is quite rudimentary and doesn’t work with
stock SLIME distributions. But this is not the worst part - the worst
part is that even this crippled SLIME is still the best development
tool for Clojure. IntelliJ’s plug-in is almost unusable, Eclipse’s is
barely usable and NetBeans’s cannot be installed half the time…</p>

<ul>
  <li>IDEs
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://plugins.intellij.net/plugin/?id=4050">IntelliJ IDEA</a> -
everyone knows how much I love IntelliJ IDEA. Sadly I cannot say
a good word about the La Clojure plug-in. Its mostly unmaintained
(and often broken), has pretty limited features and is generally
good for… nothing. It’s sad to see it’s so far back in
JetBrains’s priority list - they are doing wonderful things in
their Groovy and Scala plugins. </li>
      <li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/counterclockwise/">Eclipse</a> - Eclipse
certainly boasts the best IDE Clojure plug-in at the moment (Counter
clock-wise). It has a lot of features found otherwise only in
SLIME. It even features partial paredit support. Being the best
in such a sorry bunch is not quite an achievement, but at least
the guys there are trying really hard and I’m sure that within one
or two releases they’ll have a great product. </li>
      <li><a href="http://www.enclojure.org/">NetBeans</a> - The Enclojure plug-in
seems to be abandoned currently. It has no released a new version
in over an year and the old one were buggy as hell (when they the
decency to get themselves installed, that is).</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/technomancy/swank-clojure">SLIME</a> - The Ultimate Clojure programming environment. Even though
it’s lacking a few features of the Common Lisp counterpart, SLIME
still is the best option for Clojure development, uniquely
attuned to the Lisp philosophy of interactive and incremental development.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Luckily there’s no lack of good build tools that one can use with Clojure.</p>

<h1 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h1>

<p>Clojure is a radical departure from both traditional Algol-derived
languages and existing Lisp dialects. Its advanced support for
functional programming, combined with a state of the art concurrency
support make it attractive language for the development of heavy duty
enterprise grade systems. Coupled with the seamless Java integration
the sky seems to be the limit for Clojure…</p>

<p>Unfortunately Clojure has to face several problems if it’s to
succeed. First of all it has to attract a critical mass of developers
that are not afraid of the syntactic difference with common
languages. Then there is the concept of functional thinking - a way of
thinking quite foreign to most developers. To be able to properly
leverage the full power of Clojure developers have to be ready to
overcome a steep learning curve, but rest assured, the prize at the
end of the journey is well worth it.</p>

<p>Another gripe with Clojure at this point is the lack of decent
tooling. Sure, we have the <em>supported</em> SLIME, available in ELPA, but
even Emacs users are not particularly happy with it. And let’s face
reality - it’s quite unlikely that many developers will be willing to
give up the comfort of their beloved IDEs just to be able to code in
Clojure. Eclipse, IntelliJ &amp; NetBeans are unfortunately nowhere near
providing a good Clojure experience. Hopefully, this will change
soon…</p>

<p>I’m a very big fan of Lisp in general, that is no secret. I’ve tried
to be as objective as possible and abstained myself from over
extolling some of Clojure’s virtues. I’d like to say, however, that
I’m very excited that we finally have a Lisp dialect that is modern,
simple, powerful, elegant and most of all - capable of getting the job
done. I really hope that Clojure will be instrument of Lisp return on
the centre stage of programming, where it deserves to be.</p>

<p>As usual the article is very shallow overview and doesn’t even
mention some important features of the language. Be sure to check out
some of the resources mentioned.</p>

<p><em>P.S. This is the last of the articles that I’d originally intended to
write. I’m considering the possibility to write a couple of more
chapter of the Java.next() series if people are interested to read
them. JRuby will probably make an appearance, but I’d like to hear
some reader input as well. So, what JVM language do you think is
worthy enough to make an appearance in the Java.next() series?</em></p>

<h2 id="a-new-zenburn-theme-for-emacsemacs20110511zenburn-emacshtml"><a href="/Emacs/2011/05/11/zenburn-emacs.html">A new Zenburn theme for Emacs</a></h2>
<p><a href="http://slinky.imukuppi.org/zenburnpage/">Zenburn</a> is a popular colour theme for
vim, developed by Jani Nurminen. It’s my personal
belief (and probably that of many of its users I presume) that it’s one of the
best low contrast themes out there and that Zenburn is exceptionally
easy on the eyes. Btw, I love Zenburn so much that I’ve even created a
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/blog/blob/master/css/syntax.css">Zenburn theme for Jekyll</a> to be able to use for my blog.</p>

<p>The project was originally
<a href="https://github.com/dbrock/zenburn-el">ported to Emacs</a> by Daniel
Brockman, but it seems that he has lost interest in it recently - very
few updates has been published by him in the past few years. This is
the reason why I gathered all improvements that I could find laying
around the Internet and applied them to the last official Zenburn
version, effectively starting
a <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/zenburn-emacs/blob/master/zenburn-legacy.el">fork of the project</a>. So far, so good…</p>

<p>Daniel’s version of Zenburn, however, had reached a state in which it took me
too much to make improvements to it - since a lot of users had direct access
to modify it everything in it was in complete disarray - it’s full of
uses of colours that were not defined by the original zenburn,
questionable coding practices and inconsistent theming of
faces. Yesterday I decided to take a closer look at the code of the
theme and clean it up a little - 20 minutes later I was writing <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/zenburn-emacs/blob/master/zenburn.el">a new
zenburn theme from scratch</a>. I decided that making everything from
the start will probably be less effort anyways. </p>

<p>I’ve added enough faces in the new theme to make it usable for most
users and I’ll (hopefully) continue to improve the theme and expand
the supported modes constantly. If you’re interested - give it a try!
If you’re unhappy with something - create an issue in GitHub (or even
better send me a pull request with your suggested improvements).</p>

<p>It’s my desire to make the new <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/zenburn-emacs">Zenburn for Emacs</a> just as good as the original.</p>

<h1 id="overture">Overture</h1>

<p>This is the second post from my series dedicated to modern programming
languages for the Java platform. Last time we’ve discussed the
<a href="/Java/Groovy/2011/05/06/jvm-langs-groovy.html">Groovy programming language</a>, which
is a member of the ever expanding family of dynamic programming
languages. The Scala programming language, that is the object of
today’s discussion, is different beast entirely - not only it uses static
typing(like Java &amp; C# amongst others), but it also puts a heavy emphasis on the type
system, functional and parallel programming.</p>

<p>In theory Scala runs both on the JVM and on the CLR(the .NET VM). The
Java port, however, receives a lot more attention by Scala’s developers
and it probably accounts for close of to all of Scala’s
deployments(especially in production).</p>

<p>This article is extremely hard to write for me. Unlike Groovy, I’m
deeply familiar with the language and would like to share quite a lot
with you. For obvious reasons I cannot go into much detail (otherwise
I’d have written an on-line book). You’re encourage to follow up this
article by reading some of the excellent resources, mentioned near its end.</p>

<h1 id="a-brief-history-of-scala">A brief history of Scala</h1>

<p>After having written hundreds of thousands lines of Java himself,
Martin Odersky, Professor at EPFL, was well aware of the frustrations
faced by Java programmers. He formed the vision of applying the best
knowledge of the academic research community to the problem of making
the Java programming experience better, even fun. His first pragmatic
step was Java Generics, seen as a major success by the Java
community (though we should mention that it was C# that first brought
generic programming to the masses). But for the full vision of scalable concurrent programming
to be achieved he saw that the basic Java syntax would need to
change. You simply couldn’t get there from here. But a deceptively
simple shift in syntax gained better uniformity to the object-oriented
aspects of Java, and this in turn enabled a natural fusion with
functional programming concepts which are critical for tackling
concurrency. In 2001 Scala was born. The first official version was
released in late 2003. This year it celebrates its first
anniversary in a way (depending on what do you consider the birthday).</p>

<p>Scala stands for a SCAlable LAnguage. What does this mean? Scala is
designed to tackle solutions of wildly varying sizes - from small
scripts (programming in the small) to massive distributed enterprise
applications (generally programming in the large). Scala also means
<em>steps</em> in Italian and this is the reason why most Scala books have
some form of steps on their covers (arguably this is the reason why
Scala is very popular in Italy and particularly in Milan). </p>

<p>The current production version of Scala is 2.8.1 with 2.9.0 being in
the release candidate stages.</p>

<h1 id="installing-scala">Installing Scala</h1>

<p><strong>Universal installer</strong></p>

<p>Scala has an <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/downloads/distrib/files/scala-2.8.1.final-installer.jar">universal installer</a> that could be ran on every platform
with Java installed. You can run it from the console like this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="gp">$</span> java -jar scala-2.8.1.final-installer.jar
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Alternatively, on most systems simply double clicking the installer
jar will run it(assuming you have a GUI environment and assuming that
the java command is associated with jar files - something that is
usually so by default).</p>

<p><strong>Installing from binary archive</strong></p>

<p>Just download the Scala distribution for <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/downloads/distrib/files/scala-2.8.1.final.tgz">Unix, OS X and Cygwin</a> or
the one for
<a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/downloads/distrib/files/scala-2.8.1.final.zip">Windows</a>
and extract it somewhere. I’m a GNU/Linux user and I tend to extract
all third party apps in the /opt folder:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="gp">$</span> sudo tar xf scala-2.8.1.final.tgz -C /opt
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You’d also want to add the folder containing the Scala binaries
(compiler, REPL, etc) to your PATH environmental variable. Unix users
might add something like this to their shell startup script (like
.bashrc):</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">JAVA_HOME</span><span class="o">=</span>/usr/java/latest
<span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">SCALA_HOME</span><span class="o">=</span>/opt/scala-2.8.1
<span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">PATH</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$SCALA_HOME</span>/bin:<span class="nv">$PATH</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You should now have Scala installed properly. You can test this by
typing the following in a command shell:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="gp">$</span> scala
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Which should create an interactive Scala shell where you can type
Scala expressions. </p>

<p>To run a specific Scala script type:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="gp">$</span> scala SomeScript.scala
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><strong>Linux installation</strong></p>

<p>Most Linux distributions provide Scala through their integrated
package management system. On Debian(and derivatives like Ubuntu) you
can install it like this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="gp">$</span> sudo apt-get install scala
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>On Red Hat systems the magic incantation looks like this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="gp">$</span> sudo yum install scala
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Personally I’d prefer the platform-independent installation method,
since some distribution package Scala in a non-standard manner, which
confuses IDEs for instance.</p>

<h1 id="scala-at-a-glance">Scala at a glance</h1>

<p><em>If I were to pick a language to use today other than Java, it would
be Scala…</em> - James Gosling, creator of Java</p>

<p><em>If Java programmers want to use features that aren’t present in the
language, I think they’re probably best off using another language
that targets the JVM, such a Scala and Groovy.</em> - Joshua Bloch, author
of “Effective Java” and many of Java’s core libraries</p>

<p>Scala basically is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>SCAlable LAnguage</li>
  <li>Pure OO language</li>
  <li>Functional language</li>
  <li>Statically typed language</li>
  <li>A language that integrates seamlessly with existing Java code</li>
  <li>A great community</li>
</ul>

<p>Scala’s more prominent features are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Type inference</li>
  <li>Advanced type system</li>
  <li>Improved OO model</li>
  <li>Improved imports system</li>
  <li>Simplified visibility rules</li>
  <li>Suitable for scripting, GUI, enterprise</li>
  <li>Relies on immutable data structures by default</li>
  <li>Great support for building parallel applications</li>
  <li>Pimps (improves) a lot of standard Java classes using a technique
called <a href="http://www.codecommit.com/blog/ruby/implicit-conversions-more-powerful-than-dynamic-typing">implicit conversion</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="static-vs-dynamic-typing">Static vs Dynamic typing</h1>

<p>This is one of the oldest debates in computing and everyone with a
little bit of common sense knows that there is no definitive answer to this
so fundamental question. Both approaches have merits and drawbacks. In
recent years we saw a rapid explosion in the rate of growth of
dynamic languages which lead many people to believe that static typing
is something of the past and is headed down on the road to oblivion. I ,
however, very much doubt such a possibility. So, without further ado
here’s my take on their pros and cons:</p>

<p><strong>Dynamic typing</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Pros
    <ul>
      <li>Less verbose </li>
      <li>Better metaprogramming capabilities - it’s very easy in a
language like to Ruby to modify a class at runtime for
instance. Java developers, on the other side, can only dream for
such things…</li>
      <li>Duck typing allows to reduce immensely the coupling between your
classes</li>
      <li>Reduced development and deployment cycles - most dynamic
languages are implemented as interpreters and this way you’re
spared the tedious compilation/redeployment cycles</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Cons
    <ul>
      <li>Some might argue that type declarations serve as an additional
documentation and their lack (arguably) make the code harder to
read. Of course, when you’re following a decent naming
convention (and by that I mean that you’re using sensible
identifiers) that hardly matters.</li>
      <li>Slower performance - knowing all the types in advance,
naturally, allows the compilers to generate faster code for
static languages than for dynamic ones. Some Lisp compilers,
however, offer performance that rivals that of statically typed
programs, so it’s reasonable to expect that the situation in
this department will improve over time.</li>
      <li>It’s hard to create IDEs for dynamic languages that offer the
same level of assistance as those for static languages. The
problem stems from the simple fact that in a dynamic language
the type of an object is known only at runtime and an IDE will have
a pretty hard type guessing the types because of this fact. In
my humble opinion the lack of all the fancy IDE features like
reliable code completion and refactorings is one of the central
reasons why statically type languages like Java, C# and C++ are
still enjoying higher popularity than dynamic languages.</li>
      <li>You need to write more unit tests, because many of the simple
errors that the compiler of statically typed language will detect
will manifest themselves only at runtime.</li>
    </ul>

<p><strong>Static typing</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Pros
    <ul>
      <li>Mighty development environments, capable of compensating for a
lot of the languages deficiencies. You always get correct
completion suggestions (in a decent IDE that is), all type errors
are caught as you type (except the runtime errors that is). </li>
      <li>Reliable refactoring - you make some changes, you recompile the
project, you instantly see whether everything is OK after the
refactoring. One of the key reasons why enterprise projects are
often implemented in Java and C#.</li>
      <li>Maximum performance - when you know all the types in advance it’s
not particularly hard to generate the most efficient in terms of
performance bytecode/binary
code.</li>
      <li>You don’t need to write unit tests for errors that will be caught
by compiler.</li>
      <li>The type declarations arguably serve as an up-to-date
documentation on which you can always rely.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Cons
    <ul>
      <li>Poor metaprogramming support - statically typed system limit very
much the magic you can do in you programs. Metaprogramming is
actually considered a black art in many statically type
languages. In a functional statically typed language higher-order
functions can compensate a lot in that department. Scala happens
to be one such language, Haskell - another.</li>
      <li>Generally statically type languages are a bit more verbose -
mostly because the code is full of type annotations (languages
like Scala and Haskell, however, have found the cure for this
ailment - <a href="http://www.codecommit.com/blog/scala/what-is-hindley-milner-and-why-is-it-cool">type inference</a>)</li>
      <li>No support (in most statically typed languages) for duck typing
causes you to often link classes in hierarchies that you’d rather
avoid if you had the chance to. I should point out that languages
supporting structural types are not suffering from these
problems. Scala happens to support them from version 2.6.0.</li>

  <li>Scala removes the incidental complexity and cut right to the core of
the problem. Imagine that you want to find whether or not a string
contains uppercase characters. In Java you’d write something like this:</li>

<p>So much boilerplate code (loop, if) to express such a basic idea. In
Scala you’d simply write:</p>

<p>Scala’s code actually reads a lot like English language that makes
sense to humans - check if in <em>word</em>
there exists an uppercase character. Notice that is Scala <em>if</em> is an
expression yielding a return value, unlike in many other languages.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Scala is concise</li>
</ul>

<p>Consider this simple JavaBean (well, not exactly JavaBean to be
precise - it lacks a no param constructor) definition:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="java"><span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">Person</span> <span class="o">{</span>

</code></pre>
</div>

<p>In Scala the equivalent definition looks like this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="scala"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Person</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">var</span> <span class="n">name</span><span class="k">:</span> <span class="kt">String</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="k">var</span> <span class="n">age</span><span class="k">:</span> <span class="kt">Int</span><span class="o">)</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This is what I call a good signal-to-noise ratio.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Scala is pure OO language - everything is an object, operators are
actually methods, everything yields some result(even constructs such
as if), there are no static field and methods </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Scala is power overwhelming</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Case classes are out of the scope of this post, but I guess you get
the basic idea.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Scala is duck friendly</li>
</ul>

<p>Duck typing is nothing new for developers familiar with dynamic
languages. Its the concept that an objects type is defined not by the
objects class, but by the objects interface. This allows us to write
very flexible code that works on unrelated types (in the inheritance
hierarchy) that happen to share common methods. For instance in Ruby
we could write this code:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Duck</span> 
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">walk</span>
    <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">&quot;The duck walks&quot;</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">quack</span>
    <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">&quot;The duck quacks&quot;</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Dog</span> 
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">walk</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">quack</span>
    <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">&quot;The dog quacks&quot;</span>

<p>Scala arrays don’t have a + method, but Scala Ints do. When the
compiler sees that the + method is invoked on an object that doesn’t
have it, it starts searching for an implicit conversion to a type that
has it - like Int. Both arrays are converted to their sums and the
sums are added together in the end.</p>

<p>The REPL has an excellent TAB completion - I used it ofter. You’ll
note from these examples the flexibility and the brevity of Scala’s
syntax - no <strong>;</strong> to terminate statements (though you’ll have to use ; to
separate more than one expression on a single line). The types of the
variables are inferred by the context, without the need to
specifically specify them - if you assign a string literal to some
variable the compiler will figure out on its own that the variable
must of type String (also note that Scala strings are Java strings -
at least on the JVM). You’ve got a lot of flexibility when you’re
calling methods - you can omit the braces and the dot in some
scenarios - this makes it easy to create Domain Specific Languages in Scala.</p>

<p>The REPL outputs both the result of the expression you’ve evaluated
and the output from the evaluation (if any). The result from the
evaluation is assigned to automatically generated variables named resX
(res0, res1, res3) and you can refer to them later on.</p>

    <p>No static fields &amp; methods - replaced by companion objects (a
singleton object named the same way as the class). What would be a
static field of a static method in Java will be a companion object
field/method in Scala. This makes the Scala OO model purer than that
of some other languages (of course in languages like Ruby where
classes are objects class variables and methods have more or less
the same meaning and the model is just a pure if not purer). </p>

<h1 id="functional-programming">Functional programming</h1>

<p>Functional programming has many aspects, but to get the bulk of it you
need just two magical ingredients - support for functions as objects
and a nice array of immutable data structures. Scala, naturally, has
both. Traditionally OOP languages have rarely had much support for
functional programming, which makes it awkward to express some
problems in them. Steve Yegge wrote an excellent article on the
subject some time ago - <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/03/execution-in-kingdom-of-nouns.html">“Execution in the kingdom of the
nouns”</a>.</p>

  <li>Functions are first class objects
    <ul>
      <li>val inc = (x: Int) =&gt; x + 1</li>
      <li>inc(1) // =&gt; 2</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Higher-order functions
    <ul>
      <li>List(1, 2, 3).map((x: Int) =&gt; x + 1) // =&gt; List(2, 3, 4)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Sugared functions

    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Closures</strong></p>

<p>Closures are basically functions that have captured variables from an
external scope (variables that were not parameters of the
functions). Closures are often used as the parameters of higher-order
functions (functions that take functions as parameters):</p>

<p><strong>Functional data structures</strong></p>

<p>Functional programming revolves around the concept of immutability -
nothing is ever changed - we have some input, we get some output and
the input is not changed in the process. Consider a simple operation
like an addition of an element to a list:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the operation could modify the list to which the element is being
added</li>
  <li>the operation can return a new list that is the same as the
original, but has the additional element</li>
</ul>

<p>Functional programming favours the second approach and Scala as a
functional programming language provides data structures with the
desired behaviour. </p>

<ul>
  <li>List - think here of Lisp lists and not Java lists(unless you’re
thinking of Java linked lists that is)</li>
  <li>Maps</li>
  <li>Sets</li>
  <li>Trees</li>
  <li>Stacks</li>
</ul>

<p>Scala doesn’t force you into functional programming, though. Apart
from the List, which is always immutable, we have two types of all the
core data structures mentioned - immutable and mutable. The immutable
data structures are those imported by default to promote a more
functional programming style, but you can easily switch to the mutable
versions and program in an imperative manner.</p>

<p><strong>List almighty</strong></p>

<p>The list is a core data structure in functional programming because it is
recursively defined and therefore it’s very suitable for use in
recursive algorithms. A list is composed of cons cells, each having
two components - the value it holds and a reference to a next cons
cell. The last cell points to a special value - Nil (which happens to
represent an empty list).</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>-&gt; 2</td>
      <td>-&gt; 3</td>
      <td>-&gt; Nil</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Pattern matching</strong></p>

<p>You can think of Scala’s pattern matching as a super charged version
of switch, capable of matching on a variety of criteria and of
destructuring that matched objects. Here’s a simple example:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="scala"><span class="n">scala</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="k">def</span> <span class="n">testMatching</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">something</span><span class="k">:</span> <span class="kt">Any</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="k">=</span> <span class="n">something</span> <span class="k">match</span> <span class="o">{</span>

</div>

<p>Pattern matching gives you a new way to implement common programming
task. For instance consider the following trivial problem - computing
the length of a list:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="scala"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="n">length</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">list</span><span class="k">:</span> <span class="kt">List</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="kt">Any</span><span class="o">])</span><span class="k">:</span> <span class="kt">Int</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">list</span> <span class="k">match</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="k">case</span> <span class="n">head</span> <span class="o">::</span> <span class="n">tail</span> <span class="k">=&gt;</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">length</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">tail</span><span class="o">)</span>
  <span class="k">case</span> <span class="nc">Nil</span> <span class="k">=&gt;</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Sure, it’s not tail-recursive, but it’s pretty neat. Now that I
mentioned tail-recursion I should probably say a bit more about
it. Recursive solutions generally look very nice in source form, but
performance-wise are not that great because each recursive call
creates a new stack frame and what’s even worse is that stack frames
are limited - create too many of them and your program will blow
up. This doesn’t mean that we should start coding everything
imperatively, of course. Some compilers have the ability to optimize
away recursive calls if the last thing that happens in the recursive
function is a call to the function itself. In the case of our function <em>length</em>,
unfortunately, the last call happens to be of the method <strong>+</strong> of the
object <strong>1</strong> (of class Int). We can improve the solution this way:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="scala"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="n">length</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">list</span><span class="k">:</span> <span class="kt">List</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="kt">Any</span><span class="o">])</span><span class="k">:</span> <span class="kt">Int</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="n">lengthrec</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">list</span><span class="k">:</span> <span class="kt">List</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="kt">Any</span><span class="o">],</span> <span class="n">result</span><span class="k">:</span> <span class="kt">Int</span><span class="o">)</span><span class="k">:</span> <span class="kt">Int</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">list</span> <span class="k">match</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="k">case</span> <span class="n">head</span> <span class="o">::</span> <span class="n">tail</span> <span class="k">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">lengthrec</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">tail</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">result</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">)</span>
    <span class="k">case</span> <span class="nc">Nil</span> <span class="k">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">result</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>

  <span class="n">lengthrec</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">list</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">)</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Notice that we now have a nested helper method with a second parameter,
an accumulator value. This pattern often recurs when dealing with tail
recursion - we take the original recursive definition and introduce a
helper method using accumulator that is tail recursive. The outer
method just calls the helper method and waits for the result. The
Scala compiler will translate internally this recursive function into
a something like a loop and the performance will be greatly improved,
while preserving the clarity of the recursive approach.</p>

<p>Some languages (like Scheme) will always optimize tail calls. Because
of limitations in the JVM not all tail calls can be optimized in Scala
(for now), but
some tails recursion is better than none.</p>

<h1 id="parallel-programming">Parallel programming</h1>

<p>With the advent of multi-core processors concurrent programming is
becoming indispensable. Scala’s primary concurrency construct is
actors. Actors are basically concurrent processes that communicate by
exchanging messages. Actors can also be seen as a form of active
objects where invoking a method corresponds to sending a
message. Actors are not a new idea - Scala’s actor library draws heavy
inspiration from Erlang - a programming language notable for its
support for the development of distributed highly parallel systems.</p>

<p>The Scala Actors library provides both asynchronous and synchronous
message sends (the latter are implemented by exchanging several
asynchronous messages). Moreover, actors may communicate using futures
where requests are handled asynchronously, but return a representation
(the future) that allows to await the reply.</p>

<p>All actors execute in parallel by their nature. Each actor acts as if
it contains its own dedicated thread of execution.</p>

<p>Here’s a very simple actor example. The echoActor runs forever and
waits for messages:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="scala"><span class="k">import</span> <span class="nn">scala.actors.Actor._</span> 
<span class="k">val</span> <span class="n">echoActor</span> <span class="k">=</span> <span class="n">actor</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="k">while</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="kc">true</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
        <span class="n">receive</span> <span class="o">{</span>
            <span class="k">case</span> <span class="n">msg</span> <span class="k">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">println</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;received: &quot;</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="n">msg</span><span class="o">)</span>
        <span class="o">}</span>
    <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">}</span>

<span class="n">echoActor</span> <span class="o">!</span> <span class="s">&quot;Chuck Norris is the only real actor!&quot;</span> 
<span class="n">echoActor</span> <span class="o">!</span> <span class="s">&quot;You don&#39;t find Chuck Norris - Chuck Norris finds you!&quot;</span> 
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Here the actor just waits for messages and responds to them by
printing them to the console. Since the article’s size is already
quite impressive I won’t go into any further details about the actors.</p>

<p>I want you to know that actors are not the only way to write parallel
programs in Scala. You still have access to the native Java (or .Net)
primitive like threads, locks, executors, etc. Another option is the
Scala implementation of Software Transactional Memory(STM) - a
parallel programming model made recently popular by the Clojure
programming language. Scala’s implementation is a work in progress and
you can have a look a it
<a href="http://nbronson.github.com/scala-stm/">here</a>. STM is basically a
programming technique that lets you model concurrent operations in a
way similar to db transactions - you combine the critical code in a
transaction and if possible execute it and commit the transaction,
otherwise just rollback it and maybe try again after a while. Note that this is a
<em>great</em> oversimplification of what’s actually happening - for all the
gory details you should read the exhaustive documentation.</p>

<h1 id="tools">Tools</h1>

<p>We all know that even the best programming language can be rendered
useless by the lack of good development tools for it - powerful text
editors, integrated development environments, profilers, build tools,
etc. Scala is a relatively young programming language that became
really popular just recently and as a result there are still no
development environments for Scala as powerful as those for Java
(although since both languages use static typing eventually the
environments will be on par). Most popular Java IDEs features feature
some form of Scala support and most Java build tools as well.</p>

<ul>
  <li>IDE
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ IDEA</a> - the ultimate

buggy that the moment (which is to be expected of something with
some many beta features).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><a href="http://www.scala-ide.org/">Eclipse</a> - the most
popular Java IDE has a Scala plug-in that
until recently was mostly useless, but currently is being
totally reworked and the next stable version will bring usable
Scala support to the Eclipse users. The development of the new

SBT integration, refactorings and other goodies in an Emacs
package. The project attempts to be the equivalent of the legendary SLIME (

moment in which Twitter’s backend was rewritten in Scala (that

problem was actually resolved by great improvements in their Ruby
code base. But they use Scala there - Twitter had a Ruby-based
queueing system that we used for communicating between the Rails
front ends and the daemons that often crashed under heavy loads, and
they ended up replacing that with one written in Scala.</li>

<h1 id="comparison-to-java">Comparison to Java</h1>

<p>It’s only natural that Java developers are interested in how Scala
stacks up to Java:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pros
    <ul>
      <li>Scala is fast, just as fast as Java. Some might wonder why this
is a feature - they should take a look at the performance of the
most of the other JVM langs and they’ll understand. Granted, all
of the performance benefits come from the use of static typing
in Scala, but Scala’s code is often as concise as the code
written in a dynamic language like Ruby or Groovy. </li>
      <li>Great Java interoperability</li>
      <li>Scala removes a lot of the incidental complexity of programming
and let’s you express your thoughts directly in the source code</li>
      <li>The syntax of Scala is mostly uniform and you can usually easily
create new abstractions that look like language built-ins.</li>
      <li>Scala features great support for parallel programming.</li>
      <li>Runs on both Java and .Net (at least in theory)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Cons
    <ul>
      <li>Some aspects of the language are fairly complex like the
subtyping rules for instance. This will probably scare off some
people, but I can assure you that this complexity is superficial
and once you’ve grasped enough of Scala everything will fall
into place and seem to you the most natural thing in the world.</li>
      <li>Calling Scala from Java is not as easy as calling Java from
Scala.</li>
      <li>The core API is still subject to constant changes and most new
Scala version are not backward compatible with the old ones
(unlike in Java).</li>
      <li>Scala’s community (albeit very friendly and helpful) is current
tiny compared to Java’s. You might not get an assistance from
the community as quickly as you’d get it for Java related
problems.</li>

<h1 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h1>

<p>Scala’s future is nothing but bright. It uses static typing, which is
familiar to so many Java and C# developers, and is also the
prerequisite for creating very helpful IDEs. Scala runs on the
venerable Java platform and easily leverages all of its power while
adding a lot of magic of its own - implicits, type inference, pattern
matching, functional programming support, actors and others.</p>

<p>It’s my personal opinion that if any language has the chance to
displace Java as the king of the world - that might be Scala. In all
likelihood this will never happen - rarely has the greatest solutions
enjoyed the greatest popularity (remember the Betamax vs VHS?). I do
believe, however, that Scala will capture a significant market share
in the coming years - mainly due to it excellent support for building
distributed systems.</p>

<p>Until next time and the next chapter of the story, dedicated to the
rising star of the JVM world - Clojure.</p>

platform) for a couple of obvious reasons. Most notably it features a
huge high quality standard library and a legendary execution
environment - the Java Virtual Machine(JVM). The JVM is known to
posses the following qualities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Runs on all major platforms</li>
  <li>Enterprise ready</li>
  <li>Extremely stable</li>
  <li>Extremely fast</li>
  <li>Highly customizable - many aspects of its work can easily be
adjusted such as GC settings, heap settings, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is a terrific community around the Java platform that has
contributed an immense amount of high quality software vital to the
success of Java. Hibernate, Spring, Eclipse, NetBeans, the myriad of
Apache projects are all community efforts.</p>

<p>So far so good, but it’s not all rainbows and unicorns in the land of
Java. The Java programming language is a common source of gripe
amongst many developers for various reasons. I’ll list here some of
the more notable of them:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s not a pure OOP language(there is a difference between primitive
and reference data types)</li>
  <li>It uses static typing(highly subjective topic, but commonly brought up)</li>
  <li>It doesn’t have support for closures(which instantly kills half of
functional’s programming ideas such as higher order functions)</li>
  <li>It has limited meta programming capabilities(compared to Ruby and
Lisp for instance)</li>
  <li>There is no concept of top-level procedures(outside of class
definitions)(this makes Java unsuitable for creating “script” programs)</li>
  <li>Its syntax is too verbose</li>
  <li>It’s not suitable for the creation of DSLs</li>
  <li>Its development is sluggish and restrained by the corporate promise of backward compatibility </li>
  <li>It’s an imperative language</li>
  <li>Its parallel programming model is revolving mostly around locks and
threads</li>
</ul>

<p>Naturally there are some languages that alleviate some(most) of Java’s
problems such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ruby</li>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>Lisp</li>
  <li>Erlang</li>
  <li>Haskell</li>
</ul>

<p>They all, however, lack(with their default implementations at least)
an execution environment that can match the JVM. They also lack Java’s
immense amount of libraries currently available. When enthusiasts
started porting existing languages to the JVM this came as no surprise
- it was only logical. A good language get a good execution
environment. For instance some folks ported Ruby to Java which
resulted in JRuby, Python also got a Java port called Jython. Though a
lot of good has come from such ports they was also a price to pay. In
the case of Ruby and Python some libraries are not written in
Ruby/Python, but in C for performance reasons, which naturally leads
to problems when you factor in a Java implementation of the
language. There is also the fact that the JVM(currently) doesn’t have
support for dynamic memory dispatching which is feature vital for
dynamically typed languages to get a decent performance. For this
reason Jython is notoriously slow. The JRuby team did a much better
work, circumvented a lot of the JVM limitations and actually managed
to create a Ruby implementation that in some scenarios beats the
performance of the standard MRI Ruby 1.9 with it’s custom YARV virtual
machine implemented in C. JRuby will be the object of a further
discussion down the road. Some of the languages that were ported to
the JVM suffer from another problem as well - it’s not straightforward
and efficient in them to reuse existing Java libraries directly.</p>

<p>I’d like to lead this discussion in another direction, however -
programming languages that were implemented from scratch with the JVM
as their execution environment. While there are many of those three
stand out and have gathered a significant momentum in recent
years. They will be the subject of this post and the following
two. Without further adieu I’d like you to meet Groovy, Scala and
Clojure.</p>

<p>We’ll begin our discussion with Groovy…</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong></p>

<p><em>Before I start I’d like to point out that my knowledge of Groovy is
limited compared to my knowledge of Scala and Clojure. Despite this I
decided to share my thoughts on the language because it’s certainly one
of the most popular JVM languages out there. If I’ve made any errors
in the article I didn’t mean to insult anyone with my ignorance and
I’ll certainly be glad to fix them when someone points them out.</em></p>

<h1 id="a-little-bit-of-groovy-history">A little bit of Groovy history</h1>

<p>James Strachan first talked about the development of Groovy in his
<a href="http://radio-weblogs.com/0112098/2003/08/29.html">blog</a> in August
2003. Several versions were released between 2004 and 2006. After the
JCP(yep, you read that correct - Groovy is actually a Java standard
which is great or scary depending on your point of view)
standardization process began, the version numbering was changed and a
version called “1.0” was released on January 2, 2007. After various
betas and release candidates numbered 1.1, on December 7, 2007, Groovy
1.1 Final was released and immediately rebranded as Groovy 1.5 as a
reflection of the many changes that were made.</p>

<p>In July 2009, Strachan wrote on his blog that “I can honestly say if
someone had shown me the Programming in Scala book by Martin Odersky,
Lex Spoon &amp; Bill Venners back in 2003 I’d probably have never created
Groovy.” Strachan left the project silently a year before the
Groovy 1.0 release in 2007. Leadership of the project was assumed by
Guillaume Laforge (Project Manager and JSR-241 Spec Lead). Under his
guidance Groovy thrived and his risen to be arguably the most widely
used JVM language apart from Java.</p>

<p>Currently the development of Groovy proceeds with a very fast pace and
the latest major update 1.8.0 was released just a couple of days ago.</p>

<h1 id="installation--getting-started">Installation &amp; Getting started</h1>

<p><strong>Platform independent installation</strong>
These instructions describe how to install a binary distribution of Groovy.</p>

<ul>
  <li>download a <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/Download">binary distribution of Groovy</a> and unpack it into some file on your local file system</li>
  <li>set your GROOVY_HOME environment variable to the directory you unpacked the distribution</li>
  <li>add GROOVY_HOME/bin to your PATH environment variable</li>
  <li>set your JAVA_HOME environment variable to point to your JDK. On OS
X this is /Library/Java/Home, on other unixes its often /usr/java
etc. If you’ve already installed tools like Ant or Maven you’ve
probably already done this step.</li>
</ul>

<p>For instance here’s the relevant information of my shell’s
configuration:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">JAVA_HOME</span><span class="o">=</span>/usr/java/latest
<span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">GROOVY_HOME</span><span class="o">=</span>/opt/groovy-1.8.0
<span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">PATH</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$GROOVY_HOME</span>/bin:<span class="nv">$PATH</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You should now have Groovy installed properly. You can test this by
typing the following in a command shell:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="gp">$</span> groovysh
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Which should create an interactive groovy shell where you can type
Groovy statements. Or to run the Swing interactive console type:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="gp">$</span> groovyConsole
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>To run a specific Groovy script type:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="gp">$</span> groovy SomeScript.groovy
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><strong>Linux installation</strong></p>

<p>Most Linux distributions provide Groovy through their integrated
package management system. On Debian(and derivatives like Ubuntu) you
can install it like this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="gp">$</span> sudo apt-get install groovy
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>On Red Hat systems the magic incantation looks like this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="gp">$</span> sudo yum install groovy
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Personally I’d prefer the platform-independent installation method,
since some distribution package Groovy in a non-standard manner which
confuses IDEs for instance.</p>

<p><strong>Windows installation</strong></p>

<p>Groovy features a native <a href="http://dist.codehaus.org/groovy/distributions/installers/windows/nsis/groovy-1.8.0-installer.exe">Windows installer</a>.</p>

<h1 id="meet-groovy">Meet Groovy</h1>

<p><em>“Groovy is like a super version of Java. It can leverage Java’s
enterprise capabilities but also has cool productivity features like
closures, builders and dynamic typing. If you are a developer, tester
or script guru, you have to love Groovy.”</em> - praise for Groovy from
<a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/">http://groovy.codehaus.org/</a></p>

<p>Groovy is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is one of the two standard languages for the JVM(the other is Java
of course)</li>
  <li>is an agile and dynamic language for the Java Virtual Machine</li>
  <li>builds upon the strengths of Java but has additional power features inspired by languages like Python, Ruby and Smalltalk</li>
  <li>makes modern programming features available to Java developers with almost-zero learning curve</li>
  <li>supports Domain-Specific Languages and other compact syntax so your
code becomes easy to read and maintain </li>
  <li>makes writing shell and build scripts easy with its powerful processing primitives, OO abilities and an Ant DSL</li>
  <li>increases developer productivity by reducing scaffolding code when developing web, GUI, database or console applications</li>
  <li>simplifies testing by supporting unit testing and mocking out-of-the-box</li>
  <li>seamlessly integrates with all existing Java classes and libraries</li>
  <li>compiles straight to Java bytecode so you can use it anywhere you
can use Java</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of Groovy’s most compelling features are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pure OOP language</li>
  <li>Mostly Java compatible syntax</li>
  <li>Optional typing</li>
  <li>No need to wait for a future version of Java to get:
    <ul>
      <li>Closures</li>
      <li>Attributes</li>
      <li>Smart switch</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Duck typing</li>
  <li>BigInteger based arithmetic
    <ul>
      <li>This deserves some special explanation because of a rather
strange design decision in Groovy. Groovy will create a
BigIntiger out of a large enough number literal, but it won’t
promote the result of an integer operation into BigInteger - 
the result will actually overflow, in contrast to the semantics of most
other dynamically typed languages. Multiply 1000 * 1000000000
and you will end up with -727379968 in Groovy.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>SQL, XML &amp; Swing improvements</li>
  <li>Unified data access API</li>
</ul>

<p>A core idea, guiding the design of Groovy, is making it easy to use for
existing Java developers. Groovy’s designers have gone so far in that
direction that the Groovy compiler will happily compile most Java
source files without the need for any modifications. Groovy, however,
builds heavily upon the standard Java’s syntax and you’ll do well to
get a grip of Groovy’s core idioms. Groovy’s syntax in a nutshell:</p>

</div>

<p>From the brief overview you might have noticed that like Ruby and
Python Groovy has language support for commonly used data structures
such as lists, maps, ranges and regular expressions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>List - def number = [1, 2, 3]</li>
  <li>Map - def countries = [BG: “Bulgaria”, DE: “Germany]</li>
  <li>Range - def range = 1..1000 </li>
  <li>Regular expressions - def whitespace = /\s+/</li>
</ul>

<p>You might have noticed another interesting feature in Groovy - the
ability to combine static type(like in Java) with dynamic typing(like
in Ruby and Python). The keyword <em>def</em> is used to introduce
dynamically typed variables in Groovy.</p>

<p>Groovy comes with its very own standard library(GDK) which builds upon
the JDK(for instance the File and String classes are enhanced in
Groovy) and offer some new features like the Groovy’s famous builders.</p>

<h1 id="oop-in-groovy">OOP in Groovy</h1>

<p>Groovy is a pure object oriented language. Everything is an object,
operations are methods, etc. Compared the Java the picture looks right
about this way:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Similar capabilities to Java
    <ul>
      <li>Define classes, interfaces, enums, annotations</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Differences to Java
    <ul>
      <li>Classes (and interfaces etc.) public by default</li>
      <li>Methods public by default</li>
      <li>Property support within classes (auto-setters/getters)</li>
      <li>Duck typing</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Java developers should feel mostly at home.</p>

<h1 id="sql-and-xml-handling">SQL and XML handling</h1>

<p>Groovy offers some nice improvements over JDBC and JAXP for handling
database queries and XML parsing.</p>

<p>Groovy removes a lot of boilerplate when dealing with SQL queries
compared to the native JDBC API:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="groovy"><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">groovy.sql.Sql</span>
<span class="n">sql</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Sql</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">newInstance</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;jdbc:mysql://host/db&quot;</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;username&quot;</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;password&quot;</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;com.mysql.jdbc.Driver&quot;</span><span class="o">)</span>
<span class="n">sql</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">eachRow</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;select * from tableName&quot;</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="o">{</span> <span class="n">println</span> <span class="n">it</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">id</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s">&quot; -- ${it.firstName} --&quot;</span><span class="o">}</span> <span class="o">)</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This code is written for a connection to a MySQL database. You will
need to adjust all the parameters to newInstance to connect to your
database, especially username and password.  Finally the third line
calls the eachRow method of sql, passing in two arguments, the first
being the query string, the second being a closure to print out some
values.  Notice that in the closure the fields of “it” are accessed in
two different ways. The first is as a simple field reference,
accessing the id field of it. The second is the included Groovy
expression mentioned above.</p>

<p>So the output from a row might look like:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="go">1 -- Bozhidar --</span>
<span class="go">2 -- Maya --</span>
<span class="go">3 -- Kate --</span>
<span class="go">4 -- Valentine --</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>XML processing is common enough task in computing and Groovy’s
developers tried to make it simple and straightforward as
possible. Let’s parse the following file:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="xml"><span class="nt">&lt;books&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;book&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;title&gt;</span>Dune<span class="nt">&lt;/title&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;author</span> <span class="na">firstname=</span><span class="s">&quot;Frank&quot;</span> <span class="na">lastname=</span><span class="s">&quot;Herbert&quot;</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/book&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;book&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;title&gt;</span>Dune Messiah<span class="nt">&lt;/title&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;author</span> <span class="na">firstname=</span><span class="s">&quot;Frank&quot;</span> <span class="na">lastname=</span><span class="s">&quot;Herbert&quot;</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/book&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;book&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;title&gt;</span>Children of Dune<span class="nt">&lt;/title&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;author</span> <span class="na">firstname=</span><span class="s">&quot;Frank&quot;</span> <span class="na">lastname=</span><span class="s">&quot;Herbert&quot;</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/book&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;book&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;title&gt;</span>A Game of Thrones<span class="nt">&lt;/title&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;author</span> <span class="na">firstname=</span><span class="s">&quot;George&quot;</span> <span class="na">lastname=</span><span class="s">&quot;Martin&quot;</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/book&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/books&gt;</span>
</code></pre>

<p>All the code we need to write is:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="groovy"><span class="kt">def</span> <span class="n">books</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">XmlSlurper</span><span class="o">().</span><span class="na">parse</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;books.xml&quot;</span><span class="o">)</span>
<span class="n">books</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">book</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">each</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="n">println</span> <span class="s">&quot;Title = ${it.title}, Author: ${it.author.@firstname} ${it.author.@lastname}&quot;</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Ruby and Python developers probably aren’t particularly impressed, but
I can only imagine the look on the faces of Java developers that are
generally required to write huge amount of boilerplate code when
dealing with XML.</p>

<h1 id="builders">Builders</h1>

<p>Groovy has special syntax support for List and Maps. This is great
because it gives a concise representation of the actual object being
defined, so its easier to keep track of what a program or script is
doing. But what about programs which contain arbitrary nested tree
structures. Surely, they are the hardest ones to keep track of what is
going on. Isn’t that an area where syntactic help will be most
beneficial?</p>

<p>The answer is definitely yes and Groovy comes to the party with its
builder concept. You can use it for DOM-like APIs or Ant tasks or
Jelly tags or Swing widgets or whatever. Each may have their own
particular factory mechanism to create the tree of objects - however
they can share the same builder syntax to define them - in a concise
alternative to XML or lengthy programming code.</p>

<p>One use for builders is the generation of markup:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="groovy"><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">groovy.xml.*</span>

<span class="kt">def</span> <span class="n">page</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">MarkupBuilder</span><span class="o">()</span>
<span class="n">page</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">html</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="n">head</span> <span class="o">{</span> <span class="n">title</span> <span class="err">&#39;</span><span class="n">Hello</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">Groovy</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="err">&#39;</span> <span class="o">}</span>
    <span class="n">body</span> <span class="o">{</span>
        <span class="n">div</span> <span class="o">{</span>
            <span class="mi">3</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">times</span> <span class="o">{</span>
                <span class="n">p</span> <span class="s">&quot;Groovy power!&quot;</span>
            <span class="o">}</span>
        <span class="o">}</span>
    <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Result:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="html"><span class="nt">&lt;html&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;head&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;title&gt;</span>Hello, Groovy!<span class="nt">&lt;/title&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/head&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;body&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;div&gt;</span>
      <span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>Groovy power!<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
      <span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>Groovy power!<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
      <span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>Groovy power!<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/body&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/html&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Builders can also be used to create Swing GUIs. Here’s a very small example:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="groovy"><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">java.awt.FlowLayout</span>

<h1 id="common-use-cases">Common use cases</h1>

<p>Groovy is a general purpose language, but it’s used for some tasks
more often than for others. It’s extremely suitable for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>web application development(usually with Grails)</li>
  <li>scripting(although you have to factor in the cold startup time of
the JVM before you start writing all your scripts in Groovy)</li>
  <li>tests development - it’s a common practice in many Java projects to
have the tests written in Groovy</li>
  <li>GUI development(usually with Griffon)</li>
  <li>Rapid prototyping - you’d do a quick app prototype in Groovy as a
proof on concept and then you’d create a Java application based on
it</li>
  <li>Exploratory programming - the groovysh is a great way to test class
capabilities, methods and ideas with almost zero overhead - no
annoying compile/run cycles to slow you down</li>
</ul>

<p>When performance is critical you’d probably want to avoid
Groovy. According to some benchmarks around the Internet(like
<a href="http://stronglytypedblog.blogspot.com/2010/02/java-vs-scala-vs-groovy-vs-groovy.html">this one</a>)
Groovy is much slower than Java for certain tasks. I, however, haven’t
read any new benchmarks on the subject and have no idea how reliable
the old ones are and how relevant they are to the current Groovy
version.</p>

<h1 id="future-prospects">Future prospects</h1>

<p>With so many languages being created all the time developers
naturally ask themselves the same question over and over again -
should I waste my time learning this language? Related questions seem
to be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Will it endure the test of time?</li>
  <li>Does it have a vibrant and committed community around it?</li>
  <li>Can I find professional support?</li>
  <li>Does it integrate well with out current infrastructure?</li>
  <li>Does it have good tooling?</li>
</ul>

<p>After all most of the currently popular languages like Java, C# and
PHP are nothing spectacular on their own, but have a combination of
factors that worked in their favour to get them to the top - solid
companies behind them, many deployment options and just the right
amount of beefing up/simplifying C/C++ make existing developers transition to the
new languages a relatively easy and painless experience.</p>

<p>SpringSource(the company responsible for the creation of the popular
Spring framework, now a division of VMWare) employs most of the core
Groovy developers and offers both <a href="http://www.springsource.com/developer/grails">Groovy and Grails support</a>. The fact
that a company such as this one believes in the technology is very
important whey you’re trying to sell using Groovy in your current
company. And if you’re existing infrastructure is built around Java -
well, you have next to nothing to worry about, except maybe will Java 7
deliver the promised speed improvement for dynamic languages
implemented on top of it.</p>

<p>Presently the Groovy community is vast and rapidly growing. The
language itself - constantly evolving. </p>

<p>NetBeans and IntelliJ have built-in Groovy support, which is a big
testament to the language’s popularity as well.</p>

<p>In a sentence I don’t see Groovy disappearing or dying anytime soon
even if its original creator has lost faith in it.</p>

<h1 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h1>

<p>Groovy is a language aiming to bring dynamic productivity to Java
developer without introducing them to a steep learning curve. The
language is beautifully architectured and integrates seamlessly with
the existing Java libraries and infrastructure. My biggest gripe with
Groovy was the lack of advanced support for parallel and concurrent
programming. A few days before I wrote this article, however, Groovy
1.8.0 was released and it features the excellent library for parallel
programming <a href="http://gpars.codehaus.org/">GPars</a>. Groovy’s performance
is not stellar at this point, but I guess
this will be improved upon in Java 7. </p>

<p>With its easy to grasp Java-like syntax Groovy is a solid contender
for the attention of Java developers. A growing number of Groovy
related job offerings is a sign of Groovy’s acceptance as a industrial
strength tool. </p>

<p>Some people criticize Groovy for the lack of innovation and claim that
it’s simply an amalgam of ideas borrowed from other languages. I don’t
see nothing bad with that approach as long as the features are
tastefully combined. Groovy might not be the most elegant language out
there, but it’s one of the most practical ones and will help you get
the job done.</p>
