<p>This is a remake of the P-99: Ninety-Nine Prolog Problems collection that Werner Hett assembled over several years of teaching at the University of Applied Sciences (Berner Fachhochschule) at Biel-Bienne, Switzerland. The collection is structured into seven sections. I have renumbered the problems in order to get more freedom to rearrange things within the sections.</p><p>The purpose of this problem collection is to give you the opportunity to practice your skills in logic programming. Your goal should be to find the most elegant solution of the given problems. Efficiency is important, but logical clarity is even more crucial. Some of the (easy) problems can be trivially solved using built-in functions. However, in these cases, you learn more if you try to find your own solution.</p><p>The problems have different levels of difficulty. Those marked with a single asterisk (*) are easy. If you have successfully solved the preceeding problems you should be able to solve them within a few (say 15) minutes. Problems marked with two asterisks (**) are of intermediate difficulty. If you are a skilled Prolog programmer it shouldn&#8217;t take you more than 30-90 minutes to solve them. Problems marked with three asterisks (***) are more difficult. You may need more time (i.e. a few hours or more) to find a good solution.</p><h2 id='lisp_lists'>Lisp Lists</h2><hr /><p><strong>1.01 (*) Find the last element of a list.</strong></p><p><em>Do not use the built-in LAST function.</em></p><div class='highlight'><pre><code class='cl'><span class='nv'>CL-USER&gt;</span> <span class='p'>(</span><span class='nv'>my-last</span> <span class='o'>&#39;</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='mi'>1</span> <span class='mi'>2</span> <span class='mi'>3</span><span class='p'>))</span>

<h2 id='ruby_or_python_well_it_depends'><a href='/2011/05/03/ruby-or-python.html'>Ruby or Python? Well, it depends&#8230;</a></h2>
<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong></p><p><em>If you&#8217;re looking for a flame post - this is not one of them. I love both languages and I&#8217;ll simply compare some of their features and possible uses.</em></p><p>Ruby or Python? This is the Question! Well it might not be the Question, but it&#8217;s a common question for many developers looking to break free from the statically typed language they know and learn a dynamic language. I personally know them both(though I know a bit more Ruby, than Python) and in this article I&#8217;ll share my personal opinion on their strengths and weaknesses. You&#8217;d probably do good to learn them both, but my arguments here may lead you to pick only one of the languages depending on you preferences.</p><h1 id='installation'>Installation</h1><p><strong>Linux/Unix installation</strong></p><p>If you&#8217;re using a Linux distribution or some other Unix derivative such as <em>BSD or Solaris you&#8217;ll probably be able to install Ruby and Python through the operating system&#8217;s software management system. For instance on Debian Linux systems(Ubuntu is a popular Debian derivative) you can use apt to install them. Run the following commands as root or with sudo:</em></p><div class='highlight'><pre><code class='console'><span class='gp'>$</span> apt-get install ruby
<span class='gp'>$</span> apt-get install python
</code></pre>
</div><p>On Red Hat based distros like Fedora, CentOS, etc you can use yum instead:</p><div class='highlight'><pre><code class='console'><span class='gp'>$</span> yum install ruby
<span class='gp'>$</span> yum install python
</code></pre>
</div><p>You should keep in mind the fact that both Ruby and Python have two version that are commonly used at the moment. Ruby&#8217;s current version is <em>1.9.2</em> and Python&#8217;s is <em>3.2</em>. For various reasons(like backward compatibility for instance), however, the current versions are not widely deployed yet(especially Python 3). In most Linux distributions the package ruby will actually be Ruby 1.8.x and the package python will be Python 2.7.x. If your distribution is one of those - look for packages named ruby19(or similar) and python3:</p><div class='highlight'><pre><code class='console'><span class='gp'>$</span> apt-get install ruby19
<span class='gp'>$</span> apt-get install python3
</code></pre>
</div><p>or:</p><div class='highlight'><pre><code class='console'><span class='gp'>$</span> apt-get install ruby19
<span class='gp'>$</span> apt-get install python3
</code></pre>
</div><p>Using the distribution package management system is a simple solution, but in the case of Ruby it might not be best one. Most Ruby hackers favour a powerful bash script called RVM(Ruby Version Manager) that allows you to install several different version(or flavours of Ruby) and switch easily between them. Please refer to the official <a href='https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/'>RVM documentation</a> for installation and usage instructions.</p><p><strong>Windows installation</strong></p><p>Installing Ruby on Windows used to be a pretty hard task, but this is no longer the case now thanks to <a href='http://rubyinstaller.org/'>the RubyInstaller for Windows</a>. This is a self-contained Windows-based installer that includes the Ruby language, an execution environment, important documentation, and more. It has two editions one for the older 1.8.x Ruby branch and one for the current 1.9.x.</p><p>Python has several installation options for Windows - the most obvious being the <a href='http://python.org/ftp/python/3.2/python-3.2.msi'>official Python installer for Windows</a>. <a href='http://www.activestate.com/activepython'>ActiveState&#8217;s ActivePython</a> is another popular option packed with more features, but you should keep in mind that although the Community Edition is free ActivePython is not an open-source project. Personally I prefer ActivePython. Other prebuilt Python binaries for Windows are also available, but are not commonly used.</p><p><strong>OS X installation</strong></p><p>Ruby is generally preinstalled on OSX, but OSX users can also install it via <a href='http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/'>homebrew</a> or RVM(as mentioned in the Linux section).</p><p>The is an official <a href='http://python.org/ftp/python/3.2/python-3.2-macosx10.6.dmg'>Python package for OSX</a> available. Most users will probably prefer using homebrew, however.</p><h1 id='syntax__code_structure'>Syntax &amp; code structure</h1><p>Ruby makes heavy use of braces and keywords(like do/then/end) to delimit blocks of code.

</div><p>I personally prefer the Python approach since it enforces the code semantics based on the code structure alone without imposing special syntax.</p><p>As a side node you might take under consideration that the Ruby method definition doesn&#8217;t have an explicit return value. The value of the last expression in the method&#8217;s body becomes automatically the method&#8217;s return value. Lisp developers will find this familiar. Java and C# developers will probably find it a bit confusing. There is a <em>return</em> in Ruby, though, it&#8217;s just rarely used.</p><p>Both languages have support for nested function definitions.</p><p>Both languages have support for &#8220;top-level&#8221; functions - that live(or seem to live) outside classes and modules(something not possible in Java for instance). This makes them good for general purpose scripting. While I would still prefer to do my system administration with shell and Perl scripts - Ruby and Python offer a solid alternative. Python has a richer system administration library so I&#8217;d prefer it over Ruby for such tasks.</p><p>Ruby has a lot of crust(&#8220;heritage&#8221;) from Perl - like a myriad of special variables that are now more or less deprecated. It also has much syntactic sugar - for instance do/end is commonly replaced by {} for blocks that are only one line long, there is special syntax for hashtables, whose keys are symbols, etc.</p><p>Since special symbols(non alphanumeric) are allowed in Ruby identifiers Ruby uses them to impose some naming conventions to make the source code a bit more readable in certain scenarios - for instance predicate methods(those that return true or false) have names that end with ?(usually) like even?, odd?, prime?, etc. Methods that mutate the object on which they were invoked generally have the ! suffix - sort!, map!, etc. I find this a nice decision. In Ruby you generally have many ways to achieve the same result:</p><div class='highlight'><pre><code class='irb'><span class='go'>ruby-1.9.2-p0 &gt; 1.even?</span>
<span class='go'> =&gt; false </span>

<span class='go'> =&gt; [1, 2, 3] </span>
<span class='go'>ruby-1.9.2-p0 &gt; arr.map { |x| x * 2 }</span>
<span class='go'> =&gt; [2, 4, 6] </span>
<span class='go'>ruby-1.9.2-p0 &gt; arr</span>
<span class='go'> =&gt; [1, 2, 3] </span>
<span class='go'>ruby-1.9.2-p0 &gt; arr.map! { |x| x * 2 }</span>
<span class='go'> =&gt; [2, 4, 6] </span>
<span class='go'>ruby-1.9.2-p0 &gt; arr</span>
<span class='go'> =&gt; [2, 4, 6] </span>
<span class='go'>ruby-1.9.2-p0 &gt; (1..5).reduce(:*)</span>

<span class='go'>ruby-1.9.2-p0 ?&gt;  end</span>
<span class='go'> =&gt; 120 </span>
</code></pre>
</div><p>No such things in Python, however. Python&#8217;s philosophy is one of simplicity - no excessive syntax sugar, one true way of doing things.</p><p>Both languages have powerful features for organising code in libraries. I would not go into any details on the subject here, but I&#8217;ll share with you the fact that I like Python&#8217;s more.</p><p>Both languages come with a REPL in which you can do some exploratory programming. Ruby&#8217;s REPL(irb) allows you to do TAB smart completion(amongst other things) by default. To get TAB completion in the Python REPL you&#8217;d have to execute this bit of code first:</p><div class='highlight'><pre><code class='pycon'><span class='gp'>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class='kn'>import</span> <span class='nn'>readline</span><span class='o'>,</span> <span class='nn'>rlcompleter</span>
<span class='gp'>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class='n'>readline</span><span class='o'>.</span><span class='n'>parse_and_bind</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='s'>&quot;tab: complete&quot;</span><span class='p'>)</span>
</code></pre>
</div><p>Alternative you can just stick this code snippet in the <strong>~/.pythonrc.py</strong> file(create it if it doesn&#8217;t exist). If you are using Windows adjust accordingly(you will have to figure out where pythonrc.py is located there).</p><p>Ruby does not have statements - only expressions. This basically means that everything(objects, method calls) evaluate to some value(though the value might not be helpful always).</p><p>In Python there are some statements such as assignment and <em>if</em>. One thing I dislike about the Python REPL is that it doesn&#8217;t print None values. Compare this bit of Python code:</p><div class='highlight'><pre><code class='pycon'><span class='gp'>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class='k'>print</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='s'>&quot;this is a test&quot;</span><span class='p'>)</span>
<span class='go'>this is a test</span>
</code></pre>
</div><p>to this Ruby snippet:</p><div class='highlight'><pre><code class='irb'><span class='go'>ruby-1.9.2-p0 &gt; puts &quot;this is a test&quot;</span>
<span class='go'>this is a test</span>
<span class='go'> =&gt; nil </span>
</code></pre>
</div><p>In the Python version we see only the side-effect(the printing), but not the return value.</p><p>Python also ships with a minimalistic IDE called IDLE. If you don&#8217;t have it by default after a python installation on Linux probably you&#8217;re vendor decided to package IDLE as a separate package. IDLE offers basic features like syntax highlighting, code completion and integration with a debugger. It&#8217;s a good tool for exploratory programming, but I advise you to pick another tool for serious development.</p><h1 id='naming_conventions'>Naming conventions</h1><p>The naming conventions for both Ruby and Python are mostly the same which is good if you&#8217;re using them both on a daily basis - less room for confusion.</p><ul>
<li>variable and method names consisting of more then one word are written in lowercase with underscores separating the individual words like_this.</li>

<li>Class names start with capital letter and follow the camel case naming convention LikeThis. Some of Python&#8217;s core classes, however, violate this convention.</li>

<li>Constants are generally written in all caps with underscores separating the individual words LIKE_THIS.</li>
</ul><p>As I mentioned earlier it&#8217;s customary to add ? as a suffix to predicate methods and ! to mutator methods in Ruby. This convention is not always followed unfortunately, even in Ruby&#8217;s standard library.</p><h1 id='oop_support'>OOP support</h1><p>Both Ruby and Python are famous members of the family of object oriented languages. Unlike languages such as Java and C#, however, Ruby and Python are pure OOP languages. There is no distinction between primitive types(such as numbers, characters and booleans) and reference types(classes). Everything in them is an object and in that sense it&#8217;s an instance of some class:</p><div class='highlight'><pre><code class='pycon'><span class='gp'>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class='nb'>type</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='mi'>1</span><span class='p'>)</span>

<span class='gp'>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class='nb'>type</span><span class='p'>((</span><span class='mi'>1</span><span class='p'>,</span> <span class='mi'>2</span><span class='p'>,</span> <span class='mi'>3</span><span class='p'>))</span>
<span class='go'>&lt;type &#39;tuple&#39;&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
</div><p>And in Ruby:</p><div class='highlight'><pre><code class='irb'><span class='go'>ruby-1.9.2-p0 &gt; 10.class</span>
<span class='go'> =&gt; Fixnum </span>
<span class='go'>ruby-1.9.2-p0 &gt; &quot;string&quot;.class</span>
<span class='go'> =&gt; String </span>
<span class='go'>ruby-1.9.2-p0 &gt; [].class</span>
<span class='go'> =&gt; Array </span>
</code></pre>
</div><p>As you can see core Ruby classes tend to have a bit more standard and descriptive names than their Python counterparts. You can also notice that in Python for some task we use built-in functions like type, instead of method calls. The built-in function will eventually result in a method invocation(like &#8220;string&#8221;.__class__ in the case of type(&#8220;string&#8221;)), but I find this irregularity in the syntax a bit irritating.</p><p>Method invocation is more flexible in Ruby - you can omit braces in some scenarios. This is handy when you&#8217;re designing a DSL or you&#8217;re trying to implement the uniform access patterns(data should be accessed through fields and methods in the same manner(read this as with no braces in method invocations)). On the other hand Python&#8217;s uniform syntax makes it easier to spot method invocations.</p>
<p><p>Both languages don&#8217;t have operators - just methods. Ruby&#8217;s OO support seems to be a bit more mature and polished(at least to me), but Python&#8217;s has some touches as well. I particularly like the explicit self references that are required when you try to access class members. I&#8217;m not too found of the use of special sigils in Ruby to mark instance(@) and class members(@@). Though they make them visually distinctive I think we could have lived without them - I&#8217;m generally not a fan of non-uniform syntax rules(and you guessed it - my favourite language is Lisp).</p></p>
<p>Ruby&#8217;s metaprogramming model arguably gives it an edge in the OOP department, but I won&#8217;t be discussing the metaprogramming issues here since they are quite lengthy.</p><h1 id='functional_programming_support'>Functional programming support</h1><p>Functional programming has been on the rise lately and it&#8217;s useful to examine what kind of support both languages provide for it. Both have support for lambda functions and respectively - higher-order functions(functions that accept functions as parameters). Ruby has code blocks, Python has list comprehensions(generally favoured over higher-order functions). Both languages lack in their standard libs the immutable data structures that generally are the code of most functional programming languages. Here&#8217;s a few example related to filtering a sequence based on some predicate:</p><div class='highlight'><pre><code class='pycon'><span class='gp'>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class='nb'>filter</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='k'>lambda</span> <span class='n'>x</span><span class='p'>:</span> <span class='n'>x</span> <span class='o'>%</span> <span class='mi'>2</span> <span class='o'>==</span> <span class='mi'>0</span><span class='p'>,</span> <span class='nb'>range</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='mi'>1</span><span class='p'>,</span> <span class='mi'>11</span><span class='p'>))</span>

</div><p>Ruby&#8217;s functional programming support seems to be better to me, but this is of course subjective.</p><h1 id='gui_programming'>GUI programming</h1><p>Python has tkinker by default - a wrapper around the Tk library(which sucks in my humble opinion). Ruby doesn&#8217;t have even this much. Both have binding for the popular GUI toolkits such wxwidgets, GTK, QT. From my experimentation with them I can tell you that you&#8217;ll be much better off with Python in that department. It&#8217;s not wonder that many GTK+ applications these days are implemented in Python. Most Ruby bindings projects seem to be in a state of disarray, abandonment - I guess we have to thank Rails for that. Most people think of Rails as the only use of Ruby which is sad&#8230;</p><p>Ruby devs shouldn&#8217;t despair however. JRuby(Ruby&#8217;s port to the JVM) has an excellent support for the superb Swing GUI framework and MacRuby has great support for building Cocoa Apps for OS X. I personally think that JRuby is the best Ruby distribution out there, but that&#8217;s the point of another post entirely.</p><h1 id='3rd_party_library_availability_and_installation'>3rd party library availability and installation</h1><p>It&#8217;s not secret that part of Python&#8217;s philosophy is that it comes with batteries included - meaning that it&#8217;s standard library is vast and covers a lot of common tasks. In case you can&#8217;t find what you&#8217;re looking for in it you&#8217;re left with an number of third party libraries for Python whose number can only be described by the word epic and that cover every task conceivable. <a href='http://pypi.python.org/pypi'>PyPi</a> maintains an up-to-date list of Python packages.</p><p>You have several options in the department of python package management. If you&#8217;re using ActivePython you can use the excellent <a href='http://code.activestate.com/pypm/'>PyPM</a> tool, which provides quick installation of thousands of packages for many Python versions and platforms for ActivePython distributions.</p><p><a href='http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall'>EasyInstall</a> is another popular solution that works with the standard Python distribution. Like PyPM it allows you easily search for and install Python packages from the PyPI that are bundled in Python&#8217;s standard egg format(Jave developers might think of eggs as jars). EasyInstall has splendid documentation so I won&#8217;t go into any details here.</p><p><a href='http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/index.html'>pip</a> is a replacement for easy_install. It uses mostly the same techniques for finding packages, so packages that were made easy_installable should be pip-installable as well.</p><p>pip is meant to improve on EasyInstall. Some of the improvements:</p><ul>
<li>All packages are downloaded before installation. Partially-completed installation doesn’t occur as a result.</li>

<li>Care is taken to present useful output on the console.</li>

<li>The reasons for actions are kept track of. For instance, if a package is being installed, pip keeps track of why that package was required.</li>

<li>Error messages should be useful.</li>

<li>The code is relatively concise and cohesive, making it easier to use programmatically.</li>

<li>Packages don’t have to be installed as egg archives, they can be installed flat (while keeping the egg metadata).</li>

<li>Native support for other version control systems (Git, Mercurial and Bazaar)</li>

<li>Uninstallation of packages.</li>

<li>Simple to define fixed sets of requirements and reliably reproduce a set of packages.</li>
</ul><p>pip doesn’t do everything that easy_install does. Specifically:</p><ul>
<li>It cannot install from eggs. It only installs from source. (In the future it would be good if it could install binaries from Windows .exe or .msi – binary install on other platforms is not a priority.)</li>

<li>It doesn’t understand Setuptools extras (like package<span>test</span>). This should be added eventually.</li>

<li>It is incompatible with some packages that extensively customize distutils or setuptools in their setup.py files.</li>
</ul><p>Linux users will also find a great selection of Python libraries prepackaged for use with the distribution&#8217;s package manager.</p><p>Ruby has an application that is more or less equivalent to EasyInstall called <a href='http://rubygems.org/'>RubyGems</a>(gems are the standard way to distribute Ruby libraries). Linux users can of course install Ruby libraries with the distribution&#8217;s package manager as well.</p><p>RubyGems has the following features:</p><ul>
<li>Easy Installation and removal of RubyGems packages and their dependents.</li>

<li>Management and control of local packages</li>

<li>Package dependency management</li>

<li>Query, search and list local and remote packages</li>

<li>Multiple version support for installed packages</li>

<li>Web-based interface to view the documentation for your installed gems</li>

<li>Easy to use interface for building gem packages</li>

<li>Simple server for distributing your own gem packages</li>

<li>Easy to use building and publishing of gem packages</li>
</ul><p>Using RubyGems, you can:</p><ul>
<li>download and install Ruby libraries easily</li>

<li>not worry about libraries A and B depending on different versions of library C</li>

<li>easily remove libraries you no longer use</li>

<li>have power and control over your Ruby platform!</li>
</ul><p>A reader pointed out that about 23000 packages are available for installation through RubyGems and 15000 through PyPI. This, however, cannot be considered as a certain sign that there are more libraries available for Ruby than for Python.</p><p>Although tools like EasyInstall and RubyGems are easy to use and quite handy, I as a long-time Linux users dislike them a bit, since they circumvent the distributions native package handling. Unfortunately package maintainers cannot find the time to package every Python and Ruby library available so I guess EasyInstall and RubyGems won&#8217;t be going anywhere soon and of course we have to consider Windows users for whom such applications are of great value given the lack of unified package management on Windows.</p><p>One thing to keep in mind about installing eggs and gems is that some of them are implemented in C(usually for performance reasons) and are locally built prior to their installation - an operation bound to fail if you don&#8217;t have a C compiler installed.</p><h1 id='misc'>Misc</h1><p>In terms of performance of the default interpreters CPython and MRI Ruby Python is the clear winner. One should note, however, is that there are many how quality implementation of Ruby and Python for different platforms where the performance situation differs wildly. For instance Jython is much slower that JRuby. With the addition of invoke_dynamic in JDK7(basically bytecode level support for dynamic method dispatch) the performance of JRuby and Jython could potentially be improved greatly.</p><p>In terms of overall usage, market share, job offers and sheer size of the community and available libraries Python is ahead of Ruby as well. One of the main supporters of Python is after all none other than the mighty Google. Ruby has also the unfortunate luck to be living in the shadow of a single application written in Ruby - Ruby on Rails, that is arguably more popular than the language itself.</p><p>Tooling for dynamic languages is currently not as advance as the one for static languages. People often joke that Python(Ruby) &gt; Java(C#), but Python + any python IDE &lt; Java + IntelliJ IDEA(Eclipse/NetBeans). Python and Ruby IDEs seem to be mostly on par currently. I do all of my Ruby and Python coding in Emacs, but I do like RubyMine and PyCharm.</p><p>Since they are often used for the creation of webapps one should consider the deployment issue. Most web hosting companies provide cheap Python hosting, but very few companies provide Ruby hosting.</p><h1 id='the_python_3_problem'>The Python 3 problem</h1><p>Python 3 was a great undertaking that improved on a lot of aspects of the language(for example Unicode support) and the standard library. To do this it dropped backward compatibility, an act that slowed it&#8217;s adoption immensely.

<h2 id='parsing_numbers_from_string_in_common_lisp'><a href='/2011/04/30/parsing-numbers-from-string-in-lisp.html'>Parsing numbers from string in Common Lisp</a></h2>
<p>One task that often recurs in programming is the need to parse a string representation a number(or several numbers) and convert it to its numeric value. Parsing integer value in Common Lisp is fairly straightforward process - we have the built-in function <strong>PARSE-INTEGER</strong>:</p><div class='highlight'><pre><code class='cl'><span class='p'>(</span><span class='nb'>parse-integer</span> <span class='s'>&quot;100&quot;</span><span class='p'>)</span> <span class='c1'>;; =&gt; 100</span>
<span class='p'>(</span><span class='nb'>parse-integer</span> <span class='s'>&quot;100&quot;</span> <span class='ss'>:radix</span> <span class='mi'>2</span><span class='p'>)</span> <span class='c1'>;; =&gt; 4</span>
</code></pre>
</div><p>As you can see the function allows you to parse a string representation of a number in an arbitrary base system(the default is the <em>decimal</em>). With the keyword argument <strong>:radix</strong> you can specify a base in the interval 2-36. The function has a few other fancy capabilities as well - like the ability to process only a part of the string that has been passed to it and to ignore junk in the input string. For all the gory details refer to the <a href='http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_parse_.htm'>Lisp HyperSpec</a>.</p><p>The problem that most Lisper face soon after is that there is no matching function PARSE-FLOAT or PARSE-DOUBLE. I&#8217;m not sure what technical reason is hidden beneath this design decision, but I know of simple way to parse floating point numbers non-the-less. It&#8217;s built around the <strong>READ</strong>(The R in REPL) function that allows you read any S-expression from a string form. The READ function then returns a Lisp object corresponding to the S-expression read. With that knowledge and the fact that READ accepts as an optional argument an input stream from which to read that S-expression(the default is the the standard input) we can write the following bit of parsing code:</p><div class='highlight'><pre><code class='cl'><span class='p'>(</span><span class='nb'>with-input-from-string</span> <span class='p'>(</span><span class='nv'>in</span> <span class='s'>&quot;3.14&quot;</span><span class='p'>)</span>
  <span class='p'>(</span><span class='nb'>read</span> <span class='nv'>in</span><span class='p'>))</span>
</code></pre>
</div><p>Here we created an input stream that&#8217;s bound to the string &#8220;3.14&#8221; and read one S-expression from it - the floating point object 3.14.</p><p>We can even build a more general solution that parses several numbers in a string, regardless of their actual type(integer or floating point):</p><div class='highlight'><pre><code class='cl'><span class='p'>(</span><span class='nb'>with-input-from-string</span> <span class='p'>(</span><span class='nv'>in</span> <span class='s'>&quot;3.14 5.646 4 9.6&quot;</span><span class='p'>)</span>
  <span class='p'>(</span><span class='nb'>loop</span> <span class='nv'>for</span> <span class='nv'>x</span> <span class='nb'>=</span> <span class='p'>(</span><span class='nb'>read</span> <span class='nv'>in</span> <span class='no'>nil</span> <span class='no'>nil</span><span class='p'>)</span> <span class='nv'>while</span> <span class='nv'>x</span> <span class='nv'>collect</span> <span class='nv'>x</span><span class='p'>))</span>
<span class='c1'>;; =&gt; (3.14 5.646 4 9.6)</span>

In other words - it was an extremely good decision. :-)</p><p>So I want to finally get the word out, showcase some nice zsh features and probably persuade a couple of bash users to try it.

<p>The edit /etc/password and set there zsh as your shell:</p><p>bozhidar:x:500:500:Bozhidar Batsov:/home/bozhidar:/bin/zsh</p><p>The next time you login a terminal wizard with start up asking you about some basic zsh options that you might want to enable. I suggest you to enable them all except the beep option. In the end the wizard will save the new configuration to the file .zshrc in your user&#8217;s home folder.</p><p>Alternatively you may just use a preconfigured .zshrc, like this one:</p><div class='highlight'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='c'># Lines configured by zsh-newuser-install</span>

</div><p>I don&#8217;t like very much the default zsh prompt and I generally change it right away. Have a look at my other <a href='/2008/07/27/zsh-prompt.html'>short article</a> on the topic.</p><p>There a couple of configuration files related to zsh that you should know about:</p><ul>
<li>.zshrc - runs for each new shell(roughly equivalent to .bashrc)</li>

<li>.zprofile - runs only for login shells(like .bash_profile)</li>

<li>.zlogout - runs on logout</li>

</div><p>Please note the way in which the PATH variable is set in zsh, which differs substantially from bash(it&#8217;s just exported there as any other variable).</p><h2 id='playing_around'>Playing around</h2><p>At this point you have the legendary zsh autocompletion configured and you have enabled many of the zsh core features.</p><p><strong>autocd</strong> allows you to navigate to folders only with their name without the cd command. One of my favourite features. Now you can do things like:</p><div class='highlight'><pre><code class='console'><span class='go'>  </span>
<span class='go'>[bozhidar@bozhidar ~]$ Downloads   </span>
<span class='go'>[bozhidar@bozhidar ~/Downloads]$</span>

<p>By the way autocd was added in bash 4.0 as well. You can enable it there with:</p>
<p><p><div class='highlight'><pre><code class='console'><span class='go'>[bozhidar@bozhidar ~]$ shopt -s autocd</span>

<p><strong>appendhistory</strong> all your open shells share the same history which is handy if you want to refer commands from one shell in another with say Ctrl+R(reverse-history-search)</p><p><strong>extendedglob</strong> allows you to recursive look for files in folders:</p>
<p><p><div class='highlight'><pre><code class='console'><span class='go'>[bozhidar@bozhidar ~]$ ls somedir/**/Makefile</span>

<h1 id='keybindings'>Keybindings</h1><p>By default zsh uses Emacs keybindings which is perfect for a long time Emacs user like me. zsh doesn&#8217;t use readline, instead it has its own line editing library called zle, which is much more powerful. vi users are not forgotten and can switch zsh to vi keybindings with the command:</p><div class='highlight'><pre><code class='console'><span class='go'>bindkey -v</span>

</div><p>This will bind the Home and End keys to the commands beginning-of-line and end-of-line.</p><h1 id='aliases'>Aliases</h1><p>Zsh has three different kinds of shell aliases.</p><p><strong>Regular</strong> - same as in bash:</p><div class='highlight'><pre><code class='console'><span class='go'>alias ll=&#39;ls -l&#39;</span>
</code></pre>
</div><p><strong>Suffix</strong> - suffix aliases are supported in zsh since version 4.2.0. Some examples:</p><div class='highlight'><pre><code class='console'><span class='go'>alias -s tex=emacs</span>
<span class='go'>alias -s html=google-chrome</span>
</code></pre>
</div><p>Now when you type in the console</p><div class='highlight'><pre><code class='console'><span class='gp'>$</span> somefile.tex
</code></pre>
</div><p>it will be opened automatically with Emacs. Similarly somefile.html would be opened by google-chrome. As you might imagine this feature is quite handy.</p><p><strong>Global</strong> - global aliases can be used anywhere in the command line(as opposed to regular aliases that can used only in the beginning). Example:</p><div class='highlight'><pre><code class='console'><span class='go'>alias -g ...=&#39;../..&#39;</span>
<span class='go'>cd ...  </span>
</code></pre>
</div><h1 id='some_tips_and_tricks'>Some tips and tricks</h1><ul>
<li>
<p>press Alt+q in the middle of a command you&#8217;re typing. This will clear the console prompt and allow you execute another command(like a man lookup). Afterwards the things you&#8217;ve typed before the Alt+q will magically reappear.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Imagine you&#8217;re in the folder <strong>project/4.0/module</strong>. Typing:</p>
</li>
</ul><div class='highlight'><pre><code class='console'><span class='go'>cd 4.0 5.0 </span>
</code></pre>
</div><p>Will take you to a folder named project/5.0/module(assuming that it exists of course). In general the command has the format <code>cd old new</code>.</p><ul>
<li>zsh comes with a built-in pager(similar to less). To try it just type </li>
</ul><h1 id='conclusion'>Conclusion</h1><p>There is no easy way to sum up everything that makes zsh great in a single blog post. I&#8217;ll try to expand and improve it in time. I hope I&#8217;ve whetted your appetite to try out zsh.

<h2 id='career_development__should_i_stay_or_should_i_go'><a href='/2011/04/29/career-development.html'>Career development - Should I stay or should I go?</a></h2>
<p>I guess nothing describes more appropriately the essence of career development than the famous song by <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1Gn0e7kvTA'>The Clash</a>.</p><p>We generally have two options in front of us when we consider our careers - stay at our current company and hope to advance in it or jump ship to a new hopefully better job in another company. Both have their pros and cons which I&#8217;ll shortly discuss. Mind, though, that I&#8217;m no HR specialist or a pro career adviser so you&#8217;d do well not to rely on my writing a 100%. Also everything I&#8217;ll write comes from my own experience as professional software engineer. I guess some of my advice will not apply to other careers.</p><h1 id='stay_at_my_current_company'>Stay at my current company</h1><p><strong>Disclaimer</strong> - <em>there are some companies that are so great that no one wants to leave them. This section is not about them. This is about the companies we all know and have grown accustomed to tolerate - the ones with the mostly same work, lying bosses and a lot of empty promises.</em></p><p>The idea is basic. You&#8217;ve spent some time in the company, you&#8217;re hoping that in time with hard work and dedication you&#8217;ll rise in the company ranks and you&#8217;ll get a healthy salary increase in the process.</p><p>Unfortunately this doesn&#8217;t happen quite often. Most companies have some internal salary limits and some next to irreplaceable people. This means that there is a cap at your growth there. Sure, if you stay with the company long enough - say 10 years, probably some of the irreplaceable people will be replaced, but is worth the wait?</p><p>When you sit around just doing the same things you tend to get bored and demotivated at times. You become less productive and less interested in your work in general. You just go to work, stay there for 8 hours and go home. The paycheck is the only thing of interest to you and you become duller and duller by the day.</p><p>This is what I call &#8220;flowing down the current&#8221;. One of my former bosses used to say that when you start feeling you&#8217;re flowing down the current you should immediately start looking for another job(that is unless you&#8217;re one of the those people that just like to complain how they hate their job, but actually doesn&#8217;t mind to sit around doing nothing and get paid for it). My boss also used to say that one shouldn&#8217;t spend more than 3 or 4 years in a company he doesn&#8217;t own.</p><p>Of course you shouldn&#8217;t jump between jobs every 6 or so months because this will make you a blacklisted candidate by most HRs - after all they&#8217;re looking most of the time for people ready to commit to their cause for at least a few years.</p><p>Pros of staying:</p><ul>
<li>you know the game and how to play it</li>

<li>you&#8217;re accustomed to colleagues, the office and you don&#8217;t have to change them</li>

<li>you&#8217;ve got a guaranteed paycheck that is unlikely to evaporate</li>

<li>if the company is bigger(100+) you&#8217;ve got a fair chance to advance in the company hierarchy if you&#8217;re willing to stay long enough</li>
</ul><p>Cons of staying:</p><ul>
<li>you limit your professional development</li>

<li>you limit the possibilities for salary improvements</li>
</ul><p>In the end it seems to me that most people are not too fond of taking chances(me included). This is the reason that a lot of average companies have employees that could do a lot better somewhere else. This is partly caused by our very own society - the people and media around us keep telling us that we&#8217;re mostly the same, that it&#8217;s unlikely we&#8217;ll ever achieve something great, something monumental&#8230; and many of us do believe them.</p><p>Hristo Stoichkov might not be the all time greatest philosopher, but said something extremely important once(or twice) - &#8220;If you don&#8217;t play you can&#8217;t win&#8221;(in Bulgarian - &#8220;Който не играе не печели.&#8221;).</p><h1 id='move_to_another_company'>Move to another company</h1><p>Moving to another company is not a silver bullet. Most of the time it guarantees you a higher salary(the top reason why people switch jobs), but it doesn&#8217;t certainly mean you&#8217;ll have a more interesting and fulfilling work. This is especially true if you go to work for some huge corporation and you&#8217;re not part of its Research&amp;Development department. I generally avoid such job offers. Corporations offer some measure of security, but little if any excitement.</p><p>I think that most people should try to find employment in companies that are start-ups or that regularly start to work on new projects. There one has plenty of opportunities to prove himself and to advance in the company along the way. Of course such companies have the nasty habit of going down under from time to time so you have to think long and hard before joining one if you&#8217;re living under rent or have to pay down-payments on two mortgages. Of course if you&#8217;re good enough at your job - you&#8217;ll find a new one soon enough and that shouldn&#8217;t really be bothering you.</p><p>Pros of moving: * moving to a new company is likely to represent a raise in your salary you&#8217;ll have to wait several years to get with your current employer * there is a strong possibility that your new work will be more exciting than your old one(after all you&#8217;ve tried to pick a more exciting job, right?) * you might get to meet some interesting new people, learn from them and improve your professional skills</p><p>Cons of moving: * you have to prove your worth again(you&#8217;ve already did this in your old job)</p><ul>
<li>the is the factor of uncertainty every time you start something new</li>

<li>you&#8217;ll have to learn how to work and deal with your new colleagues</li>

<li>you might get more of the same work that made you leave in the first place in case you have not chosen carefully your new employer.</li>
</ul><h1 id='conclusion'>Conclusion</h1><p>Topics such a career development are highly subjective and depend on a myriad of factors. My musings here are inspired by my 7 year long career as a software engineer that spanned over four employers and will probably soon include a fifth. This is not a lot of data to consider, but I can assure you that the traits that I describe are most real and are here to stay.</p><div style='font-style: italic; color: #7f9f7f;'>Posted on 29 Apr 2011 by Bozhidar.</div>
