<p>I love reading - I love fiction, I love technical literature, I love newspapers and magazines. I&#8217;m also a bit of old fashioned - I love the feel and smell of paper, I love the ability to feel the pages. So it took me quite some time to convince myself to buy one of the fabled Amazon Kindle e-book reading devices. People often ask me what I think about it and would I recommend them to buy one so I decided to write down my thoughts here.</p><h2 id='the_things_i_love_about_the_kindle'>The things I love about the Kindle</h2><hr /><h1 id='typography'>Typography</h1><p>The typography of the fiction books on the Kindle is simply amazing - the fonts and the typesetting are close to perfect. The only thing that is a bit off is the justification of some lines but this happens very rarely. Most of the paper books I&#8217;ve recently bought have so terrible typography that they simply appal me.</p><h1 id='quality_of_images'>Quality of images</h1><p>This one really surprised me - the images and photos look very good on the Kindle(unless they are very big and have to be scaled down).</p><h1 id='navigation'>Navigation</h1><p>The navigation is outstanding - I think the idea to double the buttons for forward/backward page was a brilliant one. The ability to skip chapters and to easily navigate the table of contents is fairly handy as well. Unfortunately not all mobi books are created with an useful table of contents, but this is not a problem of the Kindle itself.</p><h1 id='builtin_dictionary'>Built-in dictionary</h1><p>Although my knowledge of English is considered quite considerable I&#8217;m no native speaker and when I read fancy books from time to time I encounter words I do not know. Having the built-in dictionary I can just move the cursor to the word in question and I see its meaning inline. This is so very cool!</p><h1 id='weight__size'>Weight &amp; size</h1><p>The Kindle is smaller and lighter than most paperbacks. And you can carry literary hundreds of books on your kindle.</p><h1 id='battery_life'>Battery life</h1><p>Without the wireless the battery lasts for about a month&#8230;</p><h1 id='amazon_kindle_store'>Amazon Kindle store</h1><p>It&#8217;s so easy to find and buy the books you want. You have the option to buy something from the website and it will be automatically sent to your Kindle or you can find and buy books from the Kindle itself if you&#8217;re connected to the Internet.</p><h1 id='free_3g'>Free 3G</h1><p>The Amazon Kindle store is always at hand.</p><h1 id='the_official_lighted_leather_cover'>The official lighted leather cover</h1><p>The cover is made of leather and makes the Kindle appearance quite similar to that of a real book. It also features LED light powered by the Kindle itself with which you can easily read even in the darkest places. Unfortunately it&#8217;s very expensive - it costs half as much as the Kindle&#8230;</p><h1 id='eink_screen'>E-ink screen</h1><p>Looks like a real book, immune to sunlight, great contrast.</p><h1 id='collections'>Collections</h1><p>You can organise your books into collections on various criteria.</p><h1 id='ebooks_are_generally_cheaper'>Ebooks are generally cheaper</h1><p>This is not true for all books(at least not yet). At least you save the shipping expenses(if you have any).</p><h1 id='highlights_and_sharing'>Highlights and sharing</h1><p>You can see passages other people highlighted as interesting and add highlights and notes yourself. You can also tweet passages and stuff like that. The Kindle is social&#8230;</p><h2 id='the_things_i_dont_like'>The things I don&#8217;t like</h2><hr /><h1 id='pdf_support'>PDF support</h1><p>It&#8217;s so horrible I can barely describe it. Basically PDF are unreadable and everyone that tell you otherwise is lying to you. The Kindle DX is large enough to accommodate PDF I guess, but not the normal Kindle.</p><h1 id='formatting_is_terrible_in_technical_books'>Formatting is terrible in technical books</h1><p>If you read a lot of books with diagrams, tables, source code, etc the Kindle is not for you(or at least not for that task). Everything is scrambled and confusing. Basically this and the previous item made me buy an iPad 2 for reading PDFs and technical books.</p><h1 id='the_web_browser_is_mostly_useless'>The web browser is mostly useless</h1><p>The Kindle has an experimental web browser, which is mostly useless mainly due to the inherent limitation of the e-ink screen(such a enormous refresh rate).</p><h1 id='real_page_numbers'>Real page numbers</h1><p>The ability to cross reference paper pages with ebook pages was added in a recent firmware update, but I haven&#8217;t seen any books that have those page markers.</p><h1 id='keyboard'>Keyboard</h1><p>Mostly useless, probably a future version with some touchscreen display would drop it. It just takes up valuable place.</p><h1 id='screen_is_not_touch_sensitive'>Screen is not touch sensitive</h1><p>In the first day I owned the devices I often tried to turn pages by swiping the screen. I&#8217;m quite fond of touch screen interfaces and one of those can make the Kindle even smaller.</p><h1 id='magazines_and_newspapers_are_crippled'>Magazines and newspapers are crippled</h1><p>Because the publishers have to pay some fee to amazon based on the traffic they generate with their magazines/newspapers the Kindle version are generally stripped down from a lot of images and other content.</p><h1 id='no_easy_way_to_lendborrow_books'>No easy way to lend/borrow books</h1><p>Currently we have services like lendle.me, but they have a very limited library. Soon the Kindle will have built-in lending support and this will improve the situation immensely.</p><h2 id='conclusion'>Conclusion</h2><hr /><p>Basically the Kindle is the greatest thing after hot water for people that read a lot of fiction books. Everyone else should consider buying a tablet.</p>

<h2 id='incremental_development_with_scala_and_jrebel'><a href='/2011/04/26/jrebel-with-scala.html'>Incremental development with Scala and JRebel</a></h2>
<p>One of the things I love most about Lisp development is the ability to develop applications in an incremental interactive manner - you write one function, compile it, load into your current REPL session, make some adjustments and repeat this process until you get satisfactory results. You never stop to compile your project, you never have to restart your application server. Without those distractions it&#8217;s easier to maintain your concentration and to remain in the <em>flow</em>.</p><p>With languages like Scala and Java, however, you cannot do this - at least without a bit of external help. This help comes in the form of an application called <a href='http://www.zeroturnaround.com/jrebel/'>JRebel</a>, which basically reloads the classes in your program as you make changes to them and recompile them. JRebel is a commercial application and generally you have to pay to use it&#8230; unless you want to you use it for Scala development, that is. ZeroTurnaround(the company that makes JRebel) offers <a href='http://sales.zeroturnaround.com/wp-content/themes/zeroturnaround4.0/modals/applyForLicense.php'>free licences to Scala developers</a> and if you&#8217;re one of them you should definitely get one.</p><p>Installing JRebel is trivial - generally you have to only extract a zip file(or use an installer) somewhere and drop in the JRebel folder the licence file that they have e-mail you. Afterwards you simply have to integrate JRebel with your build system. JRebel can also be integrated with IDEs, but I want cover this here. I use mostly <a href='http://maven.apache.org'>Maven 3</a> and <a href='http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/'>SBT</a> so I&#8217;ll show you what to do for them. With Maven you have to add the following to the <em>$MAVEN_OPTS</em> environmental variable:</p><div class='highlight'><pre><code class='console'><span class='go'>export MAVEN_OPTS=-noverify -javaagent:/home/bozhidar/work/jrebel/jrebel.jar</span>
</code></pre>
</div><p>Since most people use JRebel for web development to avoid the need to restart their application containers and Scala&#8217;s most prominent framework is <a href='http://liftweb.net'>Lift</a> you&#8217;d probably want to enable the JRebel Lift plug-in as well:</p><div class='highlight'><pre><code class='console'><span class='go'>export MAVEN_OPTS=-noverify -javaagent:/home/bozhidar/work/jrebel/jrebel.jar</span>
<span class='go'> -Drebel.lift_plugin=true</span>
</code></pre>
</div><p>Stick this in your shell&#8217;s init file and source it to make it available in the shell.</p><p>Now when you start your web app with</p><div class='highlight'><pre><code class='console'><span class='go'>mvn jetty:run</span>
</code></pre>
</div><p>And the continuous Scala compilation with</p><div class='highlight'><pre><code class='console'><span class='go'>mvn scala:cc</span>
</code></pre>
</div><p>The compiler with pickup the changes you made and JRebel will reload the changed classes behind the scenes. The development process this way starts to feel a bit like using a scripting language such as Ruby or PHP.</p><p>If you&#8217;re using SBT you should modify the sbt startup script to include the same options that I mentioned in the section about Maven configuration. Mine sbt script looks like this:</p><div class='highlight'><pre><code class='console'><span class='gp'>#</span>!/bin/bash

<span class='go'>java -noverify -javaagent:/home/bozhidar/work/jrebel/jrebel.jar</span>
<span class='go'> -Drebel.lift_plugin=true -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled</span>
<span class='go'> -XX:MaxPermSize=512m -Xmx512M -Xss2M -jar `dirname $0`/sbt-launch.jar</span>
<span class='go'> &quot;$@&quot;</span>
</code></pre>
</div><p>Another use for JRebel is the Scala REPL itself. When you start the REPL from inside SBT for instance with the command:</p><div class='highlight'><pre><code class='console'><span class='go'>sbt console</span>
</code></pre>
</div><p>changes to the imported classes will be reflected automatically without the need to do a <em>:replay</em> or restart the REPL - something reminiscent of the interactive Lisp programming I mentioned earlier.</p><p>So what are you waiting for? Go grab JRebel and speed up your Scala development process.</p>

<h2 id='emacs_dev_kit'><a href='/2011/04/24/emacs-dev-kit.html'>Emacs Dev Kit</a></h2>
<p>During the past few months I&#8217;ve been working on a project to convert my vast Emacs configuration into something generally useful and self-contained that could help the general software engineer. Thus the <a href='https://github.com/bbatsov/emacs-dev-kit'>Emacs Dev Kit</a> was born. Conceptually it&#8217;s similar to the older <a href='https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit'>Emacs Starter Kit</a> and it even shares a bit of code with it. The Emacs Dev Kit, however, target more programming languages and features more customizations/enhancements.</p><p>EDT relies on ELPA for packages that are available there and packages everything else locally. At some point I&#8217;ve played with the idea of using el-get instead, but I had a lot of problems with it and thought that using only ELPA would be better since it would be part of Emacs 24. Everything is tested only on the latest version of GNU Emacs(currently 23.2). I&#8217;ve tried to do everything in the most efficient and modern way - for instance SLIME is supposed to be installed via Quicklisp so it could be easily updated without waiting for a new version of the EDK.</p><p>EDK currently offers enhanced(well, I know that this is subjective, but it feels enhanced at least to me) support for the following languages:</p><ul>
<li>C/C++</li>

<li>Clojure</li>

<li>Common Lisp</li>

<li>Emacs Lisp</li>

<li>Haskell</li>

<li>Java</li>

<li>LaTeX</li>

<li>Perl</li>

<li>Prolog</li>

<li>Python</li>

<li>Ruby</li>

<li>Scala</li>

<li>Scheme</li>

<li>XML</li>
</ul><p>It also offers an advanced ERC configuration(so that you can ask your questions on #freenode), extended keybindings and lots of general purpose utility functions.</p><p>EDT goes a step further and even includes a different color-theme by default - zenburn. You can turn it off easily of course, but I have the feeling that many programmers will appreciate its eye strain reducing qualities.</p><p>The project is still very young and mostly untested. I&#8217;d be thankful for feedback, bug reports and suggestions.</p>

<h2 id='add_atom_feed_to_jekyll_powered_blog'><a href='/2011/04/24/add-atom-feed-to-jekyll.html'>Add Atom feed to Jekyll powered blog</a></h2>
<p>As you know I&#8217;ve recently migrated my blog from WordPress to Jekyll. One of the things I had to do was add an Atom feed(RSS sucks). It was quite the easy task. I just had to create an <a href='https://github.com/bbatsov/blog/blob/master/atom.xml'>atom.xml</a> file and place in the root of my blog.</p><p>Afterwards I only had to link my default layout to the atom feed:</p><div class='highlight'><pre><code class='xml'><span class='nt'>&lt;link</span> <span class='na'>rel=</span><span class='s'>&quot;alternate&quot;</span> <span class='na'>type=</span><span class='s'>&quot;application/atom+xml&quot;</span> <span class='na'>href=</span><span class='s'>&quot;atom.xml&quot;</span>
<span class='na'>title=</span><span class='s'>&quot;Atom feed&quot;</span><span class='nt'>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
</div><p>At this point I was able to subscribe to my new atom feed(and hopefully my followers(which I may or may not have) were able to do the same).</p>

<h2 id='moving_from_wordpress_to_jekyll'><a href='/2011/04/23/moving-to-jekyll.html'>Moving from WordPress to Jekyll</a></h2>
<p>This is my first post after a very long hiatus partially induced by a migration of my blog from WordPress to <a href='https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll'>Jekyll</a>, which I started half an year ago and never quite finished(until today, that is).</p><p>I wasn&#8217;t particularly unhappy with WordPress, but some things there irritated me - for instance it was hard to edit my posts within my beloved Emacs(and yes - I know all the options and I hate them all). Accidentally I&#8217;ve stumbled upon the post <a href='http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html'>&#8220;Bloggin like a hacker&#8221;</a> and I instantly knew Jekyll was what I needed. It allows me to create my posts as simple markdown templates, allows me to embed logic written in Ruby in them and it has built-in support for code highlighting(using the excellent Python library <em>pygments</em>). It also allows me to store my blog under version control in github which is really nice.</p><p>Jekyll is not particularly well documented and I had a few problems with it at first, but I managed to overcome them all. One thing that will be problematic for some users is the need to add things like rss, commenting and analytics manually(they are bundled in a solution like WordPress). On the other hand - you&#8217;re not tied to anything in particular and may choose the service you like the most. I chose <a href='http://disqus.com'>Disqus</a> for the comments and Google Analytics for the site analytics(what a surprise).</p><p>By the way - my old blog Devcraft is no more. My new blog has a new domain and a new theme(based on my favourite coding theme <a href='https://github.com/bbatsov/zenburn-emacs'>Zenburn</a>). I know that the blog is currently pig ugly and the content is not particularly great either, but I&#8217;ll try to improve this along the way and add a lot of interesting and hopefully useful information.</p>
