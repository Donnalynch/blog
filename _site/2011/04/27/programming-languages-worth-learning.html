    <h2 class="title">Programming languages worth learning</h2>
    <p>Programming languages have always been a passion of mine and through the years I&#8217;ve learnt quite a few of them. The first one was Pascal some 13 years ago and the last was Scala just a couple of months ago.</p>

<p>Although the authors of many languages claim that the language they created is the greatest thing after hot water, this is rarely the case. Most of the &#8220;unique&#8221; features are not quite unique and the truly unique stuff is often just useless. I don&#8217;t believe that there is a single greatest and unparallelled language, but I do believe that some languages are more valuable them others in term of both theory(the concepts around which they revolve) and practice(the chances of you landing a job with them or simply getting a task done).</p>

<p>In this blog post I&#8217;ve review the ten or so languages that I found to be most enlightening/helpful to me over the years. I think that every professional software engineer should have at least a passing knowledge of them.</p>

<h1 id='c'>C</h1>
<hr />
<p>The C programming language has been around for more than forty years now. While it&#8217;s often viewed as a higher level assembly language today in the era of Java, .Net and Python C remains the sole choice for doing serious system programming - writing drivers, all kinds of servers and virtual machines.</p>

<p>The best way to get started with C hasn&#8217;t changed in the past 20+ years - just pick a copy of <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-2nd-Brian-Kernighan/dp/0131103628'>&#8220;The C Programming Language&#8221;</a> by K&amp;R.</p>

<h1 id='lisp'>Lisp</h1>
<hr />
<p><em>&#8220;Lisp is worth learning for the profound enlightenment experience you will have when you finally get it; that experience will make you a better programmer for the rest of your days, even if you never actually use Lisp itself a lot.&#8221;</em> - Eric Raymond</p>

<p>One of the oldest programming languages around - created in 1958 and still relevant today. Important for its unique code is data approach, advanced code generation facilities(macros) and the ability to develop software in incremental and interactive fashion. Although many of the features that originally made it truly unique(like garbage collection, if expression, function objects) are found in many modern languages Lisp still offers some compelling alternatives for those interested to explore it.</p>

<p>You cannot start with a better introduction to Lisp that Peter Seibel&#8217;s <a href='http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/'>&#8220;Practical Common Lisp&#8221;</a>.</p>

<h1 id='java'>Java</h1>
<hr />
<p>Let&#8217;s face it - if you&#8217;re in the market for jobs a third of them are about Java EE or Android development. The language is not quite elegant, but the platform is truly magnificent. Although there are many other languages targeting the JVM(Scala, Groovy, Clojure, JRuby, Jython - just to name a few) Java is still predominant by a wide margin and this is unlikely to change soon.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve taught a couple of introductory Java programming courses(in Bulgarian), but I&#8217;d recommend the <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Core-Java-TM-I--Fundamentals-8th/dp/0132354764/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1303901341&amp;sr=1-1'>&#8220;Core Java&#8221;</a> over my lectures any day of the week. :-)</p>

<h1 id='haskell'>Haskell</h1>
<hr />
<p>Functional programming has been gaining popularity in recent years with the rise of parallel computers and of the pure functional programming languages Haskell is probably the closest to the mainstream. It features great ideas like type inference, lazy evaluation, monads, pattern matching. As with Lisp many of the features of Haskell can be found in more impure packages(like Scala and Clojure), but Haskell is still the top pure functional language in my humble opinion. It also has really great free learning resources on-line like <a href='http://learnyouahaskell.com/'>&#8220;Learn you a Haskell for great good&#8221;</a> and <a href='http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/'>&#8220;Real world Haskell&#8221;</a></p>

<h1 id='perl'>Perl</h1>
<hr />
<p>Once the undisputed king of the Internet Perl has recently fallen down from grace in its battle with the newer generation of dynamic languages like PHP, Ruby and Python. While I wouldn&#8217;t advise anyone to start writing Web apps with Perl it&#8217;s still the best language for writing administration and helper scripts with minimum fuss and maximum developer throughput. It also has the greatest support for text processing ever and an extremely flexible(albeit a bit of confusing) syntax.</p>

<p>Pick up a copy of <a href='http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596520113'>&#8220;Learning Perl&#8221;</a> or just browse the excellent <em>perldoc</em> and start coding in Perl right away.</p>

<h1 id='clojure'>Clojure</h1>
<hr />
<p>Clojure is a Lisp dialect with an unique support for parallel and concurrent programming and runs on top of the venerable JVM. If you&#8217;re looking to do some serious parallel programming look no further.</p>

<p>To get started I recommend you to watch the free Clojure screencasts on <a href='http://clojure.blip.tv/'>blip.tv</a>.</p>

<h1 id='prolog'>Prolog</h1>
<hr />
<p>The most famous language from the logic programming family. Solving a problem like a sudoku puzzle in Prolog will be an eye opening experience for any developer. While it&#8217;s unlikely that you&#8217;ll ever use it practice the ideas found in Prolog will truly expand your thinking horizons.</p>

<h1 id='ruby'>Ruby</h1>
<hr />
<p>A pure object oriented dynamic scripting language with a very nice support for metaprogramming. Has versions written in Java(JRuby) and .Net(IronRuby). The language became popular with the rise of the Ruby on Rails web framework, but it has many applications that don&#8217;t involve RoR or web development.</p>

<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Ruby-1-9-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/1934356085/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1303901367&amp;sr=1-1'>&#8220;Programming Ruby&#8221;</a> and <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Ruby-Programming-Language-David-Flanagan/dp/0596516177/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1303901367&amp;sr=1-3'>&#8220;The Ruby Programming Language&#8221;</a> are two of the best introductory Ruby books around.</p>

<h1 id='scala'>Scala</h1>
<hr />
<p>An interesting blend of pure object orientation and functional programming with some concurrency support baked in(actors). Of the current crop of JVM languages next to Clojure Scala looks most promising. It features an advanced static type system(more advanced than Haskell&#8217;s), state of the art Java integration, support for pattern matching, extractors and other functional goodness. If any language has a chance of displacing the Java programming language it must be Scala&#8230;</p>

<p>Start your journey to Scala mastery with <a href='http://www.artima.com/pins1ed/'>&#8220;Programming in Scala&#8221;</a>.</p>

<h1 id='conclusion'>Conclusion</h1>
<hr />
<p>We cannot be experts in ten or twenty programming languages - I&#8217;m certain of that. I do, however, believe that all the ideas and techniques that we discover in different programming languages will generally enrich our thinking and make us better software engineers in principle.</p>
