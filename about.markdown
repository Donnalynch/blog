title: About
---

I'm a software engineer and entrepreneur with substantial experience
in C, C++, Java, C#, Perl and Ruby development. I also happen to be
proficient in Unix like operating systems. Committed to open source,
fond of cutting edge development technologies.

I'm on a never ending quest to achieve Emacs mastery and to grasp the
Lisp and functional programming philosophy.
