title: About
---

I'm a software engineer and entrepreneur with substantial experience
in C, C++, Java, Perl and Ruby development. I also happen to be
proficient in Unix like operating systems and a LPIC2 Certified Linux
administrator. Committed to open source,
fond of cutting edge development technologies.

I've taught Perl and Java programming courses as well as Linux
administration courses throughout the years. I've also been a speaker
at a few software conferences.

I'm on a never ending quest to achieve Emacs mastery and to grasp the
Lisp and functional programming philosophy.

My hobbies include cinema, reading novels, playing the guitar and playing video
games.
